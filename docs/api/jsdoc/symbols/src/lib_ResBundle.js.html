<span class='line'> 31</span> </span><span class="COMM">/**
<span class='line'> 32</span>  * @class
<span class='line'> 33</span>  * Create a new resource bundle instance. The resource bundle loads strings
<span class='line'> 34</span>  * appropriate for a particular locale and provides them via the getString
<span class='line'> 35</span>  * method.&lt;p>
<span class='line'> 36</span>  *
<span class='line'> 37</span>  * The options object may contain any (or none) of the following properties:
<span class='line'> 38</span>  *
<span class='line'> 39</span>  * &lt;ul>
<span class='line'> 40</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>locale&lt;/i> - The locale of the strings to load. If not specified, the default
<span class='line'> 41</span>  * locale is the the default for the web page or app in which the bundle is
<span class='line'> 42</span>  * being loaded.
<span class='line'> 43</span>  *
<span class='line'> 44</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>name&lt;/i> - Base name of the resource bundle to load. If not specified the default
<span class='line'> 45</span>  * base name is "resources".
<span class='line'> 46</span>  *
<span class='line'> 47</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>type&lt;/i> - Name the type of strings this bundle contains. Valid values are
<span class='line'> 48</span>  * "xml", "html", "text", "c", or "raw". The default is "text". If the type is "xml" or "html",
<span class='line'> 49</span>  * then XML/HTML entities and tags are not pseudo-translated. During a real translation,
<span class='line'> 50</span>  * HTML character entities are translated to their corresponding characters in a source
<span class='line'> 51</span>  * string before looking that string up in the translations. Also, the characters "&lt;", ">",
<span class='line'> 52</span>  * and "&" are converted to entities again in the output, but characters are left as they
<span class='line'> 53</span>  * are. If the type is "xml", "html", or "text" types, then the replacement parameter names
<span class='line'> 54</span>  * are not pseudo-translated as well so that the output can be used for formatting with
<span class='line'> 55</span>  * the IString class. If the type is "c" then all C language style printf replacement
<span class='line'> 56</span>  * parameters (eg. "%s" and "%d") are skipped automatically. If the type is raw, all characters
<span class='line'> 57</span>  * are pseudo-translated, including replacement parameters as well as XML/HTML tags and entities.
<span class='line'> 58</span>  *
<span class='line'> 59</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>lengthen&lt;/i> - when pseudo-translating the string, tell whether or not to
<span class='line'> 60</span>  * automatically lengthen the string to simulate "long" languages such as German
<span class='line'> 61</span>  * or French. This is a boolean value. Default is false.
<span class='line'> 62</span>  *
<span class='line'> 63</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>missing&lt;/i> - what to do when a resource is missing. The choices are:
<span class='line'> 64</span>  * &lt;ul>
<span class='line'> 65</span>  *   &lt;li>&lt;i>source&lt;/i> - return the source string unchanged
<span class='line'> 66</span>  *   &lt;li>&lt;i>pseudo&lt;/i> - return the pseudo-translated source string, translated to the
<span class='line'> 67</span>  *   script of the locale if the mapping is available, or just the default Latin
<span class='line'> 68</span>  *   pseudo-translation if not
<span class='line'> 69</span>  *   &lt;li>&lt;i>empty&lt;/i> - return the empty string
<span class='line'> 70</span>  * &lt;/ul>
<span class='line'> 71</span>  * The default behaviour is the same as before, which is to return the source string
<span class='line'> 72</span>  * unchanged.
<span class='line'> 73</span>  *
<span class='line'> 74</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>basePath&lt;/i> - look in the given path for the resource bundle files. This can be
<span class='line'> 75</span>  * an absolute path or a relative path that is relative to the application's root.
<span class='line'> 76</span>  * Default if this is not specified is to look in the standard path (ie. in the root
<span class='line'> 77</span>  * of the app).
<span class='line'> 78</span>  *
<span class='line'> 79</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>onLoad&lt;/i> - a callback function to call when the resources are fully
<span class='line'> 80</span>  * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to
<span class='line'> 81</span>  * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
<span class='line'> 82</span>  * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the
<span class='line'> 83</span>  * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
<span class='line'> 84</span>  * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
<span class='line'> 85</span>  *
<span class='line'> 86</span>  * &lt;li>sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or
<span class='line'> 87</span>  * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
<span class='line'> 88</span>  * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
<span class='line'> 89</span>  * not be usable for a while.
<span class='line'> 90</span>  *
<span class='line'> 91</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>loadParams&lt;/i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the
<span class='line'> 92</span>  * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
<span class='line'> 93</span>  * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object
<span class='line'> 94</span>  * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
<span class='line'> 95</span>  * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
<span class='line'> 96</span>  * &lt;/ul>
<span class='line'> 97</span>  *
<span class='line'> 98</span>  * The locale option may be given as a locale spec string or as an
<span class='line'> 99</span>  * Locale object. If the locale option is not specified, then strings for
<span class='line'>100</span>  * the default locale will be loaded.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>101</span>  *
<span class='line'>102</span>  * The name option can be used to put groups of strings together in a
<span class='line'>103</span>  * single bundle. The strings will then appear together in a JS object in
<span class='line'>104</span>  * a JS file that can be included before the ilib.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>105</span>  *
<span class='line'>106</span>  * A resource bundle with a particular name is actually a set of bundles
<span class='line'>107</span>  * that are each specific to a language, a language plus a region, etc.
<span class='line'>108</span>  * All bundles with the same base name should
<span class='line'>109</span>  * contain the same set of source strings, but with different translations for
<span class='line'>110</span>  * the given locale. The user of the bundle does not need to be aware of
<span class='line'>111</span>  * the locale of the bundle, as long as it contains values for the strings
<span class='line'>112</span>  * it needs.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>113</span>  *
<span class='line'>114</span>  * Strings in bundles for a particular locale are inherited from parent bundles
<span class='line'>115</span>  * that are more generic. In general, the hierarchy is as follows (from
<span class='line'>116</span>  * least locale-specific to most locale-specific):
<span class='line'>117</span>  *
<span class='line'>118</span>  * &lt;ol>
<span class='line'>119</span>  * &lt;li> language
<span class='line'>120</span>  * &lt;li> region
<span class='line'>121</span>  * &lt;li> language_script
<span class='line'>122</span>  * &lt;li> language_region
<span class='line'>123</span>  * &lt;li> region_variant
<span class='line'>124</span>  * &lt;li> language_script_region
<span class='line'>125</span>  * &lt;li> language_region_variant
<span class='line'>126</span>  * &lt;li> language_script_region_variant
<span class='line'>127</span>  * &lt;/ol>
<span class='line'>128</span>  *
<span class='line'>129</span>  * That is, if the translation for a string does not exist in the current
<span class='line'>130</span>  * locale, the more-generic parent locale is searched for the string. In the
<span class='line'>131</span>  * worst case scenario, the string is not found in the base locale's strings.
<span class='line'>132</span>  * In this case, the missing option guides this class on what to do. If
<span class='line'>133</span>  * the missing option is "source", then the original source is returned as
<span class='line'>134</span>  * the translation. If it is "empty", the empty string is returned. If it
<span class='line'>135</span>  * is "pseudo", then the pseudo-translated string that is appropriate for
<span class='line'>136</span>  * the default script of the locale is returned.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>137</span>  *
<span class='line'>138</span>  * This allows developers to create code with new or changed strings in it and check in that
<span class='line'>139</span>  * code without waiting for the translations to be done first. The translated
<span class='line'>140</span>  * version of the app or web site will still function properly, but will show
<span class='line'>141</span>  * a spurious untranslated string here and there until the translations are
<span class='line'>142</span>  * done and also checked in.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>143</span>  *
<span class='line'>144</span>  * The base is whatever language your developers use to code in. For
<span class='line'>145</span>  * a German web site, strings in the source code may be written in German
<span class='line'>146</span>  * for example. Often this base is English, as many web sites are coded in
<span class='line'>147</span>  * English, but that is not required.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>148</span>  *
<span class='line'>149</span>  * The strings can be extracted with the ilib localization tool (which will be
<span class='line'>150</span>  * shipped at some future time.) Once the strings
<span class='line'>151</span>  * have been translated, the set of translated files can be generated with the
<span class='line'>152</span>  * same tool. The output from the tool can be used as input to the ResBundle
<span class='line'>153</span>  * object. It is up to the web page or app to make sure the JS file that defines
<span class='line'>154</span>  * the bundle is included before creating the ResBundle instance.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>155</span>  *
<span class='line'>156</span>  * A special locale "zxx-XX" is used as the pseudo-translation locale because
<span class='line'>157</span>  * zxx means "no linguistic information" in the ISO 639 standard, and the region
<span class='line'>158</span>  * code XX is defined to be user-defined in the ISO 3166 standard.
<span class='line'>159</span>  * Pseudo-translation is a locale where the translations are generated on
<span class='line'>160</span>  * the fly based on the contents of the source string. Characters in the source
<span class='line'>161</span>  * string are replaced with other characters and returned.
<span class='line'>162</span>  *
<span class='line'>163</span>  * Example. If the source string is:
<span class='line'>164</span>  *
<span class='line'>165</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>166</span>  * "This is a string"
<span class='line'>167</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>168</span>  *
<span class='line'>169</span>  * then the pseudo-translated version might look something like this:
<span class='line'>170</span>  *
<span class='line'>171</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>172</span>  * "Ţħïş ïş á şţřïñĝ"
<span class='line'>173</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>174</span>  * &lt;p>
<span class='line'>175</span>  *
<span class='line'>176</span>  * Pseudo-translation can be used to test that your app or web site is translatable
<span class='line'>177</span>  * before an actual translation has happened. These bugs can then be fixed
<span class='line'>178</span>  * before the translation starts, avoiding an explosion of bugs later when
<span class='line'>179</span>  * each language's tester registers the same bug complaining that the same
<span class='line'>180</span>  * string is not translated. When pseudo-localizing with
<span class='line'>181</span>  * the Latin script, this allows the strings to be readable in the UI in the
<span class='line'>182</span>  * source language (if somewhat funky-looking),
<span class='line'>183</span>  * so that a tester can easily verify that the string is properly externalized
<span class='line'>184</span>  * and loaded from a resource bundle without the need to be able to read a
<span class='line'>185</span>  * foreign language.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>186</span>  *
<span class='line'>187</span>  * If one of a list of script tags is given in the pseudo-locale specifier, then the
<span class='line'>188</span>  * pseudo-localization can map characters to very rough transliterations of
<span class='line'>189</span>  * characters in the given script. For example, zxx-Hebr-XX maps strings to
<span class='line'>190</span>  * Hebrew characters, which can be used to test your UI in a right-to-left
<span class='line'>191</span>  * language to catch bidi bugs before a translation is done. Currently, the
<span class='line'>192</span>  * list of target scripts includes Hebrew (Hebr), Chinese Simplified Han (Hans),
<span class='line'>193</span>  * and Cyrillic (Cyrl) with more to be added later. If no script is explicitly
<span class='line'>194</span>  * specified in the locale spec, or if the script is not supported,
<span class='line'>195</span>  * then the default mapping maps Latin base characters to accented versions of
<span class='line'>196</span>  * those Latin characters as in the example above.
<span class='line'>197</span>  *
<span class='line'>198</span>  * When the "lengthen" property is set to true in the options, the
<span class='line'>199</span>  * pseudotranslation code will add digits to the end of the string to simulate
<span class='line'>200</span>  * the lengthening that occurs when translating to other languages. The above
<span class='line'>201</span>  * example will come out like this:
<span class='line'>202</span>  *
<span class='line'>203</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>204</span>  * "Ţħïş ïş á şţřïñĝ76543210"
<span class='line'>205</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>206</span>  *
<span class='line'>207</span>  * The string is lengthened according to the length of the source string. If
<span class='line'>208</span>  * the source string is less than 20 characters long, the string is lengthened
<span class='line'>209</span>  * by 50%. If the source string is 20-40
<span class='line'>210</span>  * characters long, the string is lengthened by 33%. If te string is greater
<span class='line'>211</span>  * than 40 characters long, the string is lengthened by 20%.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>212</span>  *
<span class='line'>213</span>  * The pseudotranslation always ends a string with the digit "0". If you do
<span class='line'>214</span>  * not see the digit "0" in the UI for your app, you know that truncation
<span class='line'>215</span>  * has occurred, and the number you see at the end of the string tells you
<span class='line'>216</span>  * how many characters were truncated.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>217</span>  *
<span class='line'>218</span>  *
<span class='line'>219</span>  * @constructor
<span class='line'>220</span>  * @param {?Object} options Options controlling how the bundle is created

<span class='line'>530</span>      * Return a localized string, array, or object. This method can localize individual
<span class='line'>531</span>      * strings or arrays of strings.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>532</span>      *
<span class='line'>533</span>      * If the source parameter is a string, the translation of that string is looked
<span class='line'>534</span>      * up and returned. If the source parameter is an array of strings, then the translation
<span class='line'>535</span>      * of each of the elements of that array is looked up, and an array of translated strings
<span class='line'>536</span>      * is returned. &lt;p>
<span class='line'>537</span>      *
<span class='line'>538</span>      * If any string is not found in the loaded set of
<span class='line'>539</span>      * resources, the original source string is returned. If the key is not given,
<span class='line'>540</span>      * then the source string itself is used as the key. In the case where the
<span class='line'>541</span>      * source string is used as the key, the whitespace is compressed down to 1 space
<span class='line'>542</span>      * each, and the whitespace at the beginning and end of the string is trimmed.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>543</span>      *
<span class='line'>544</span>      * The escape mode specifies what type of output you are escaping the returned
<span class='line'>545</span>      * string for. Modes are similar to the types:
<span class='line'>546</span>      *
<span class='line'>547</span>      * &lt;ul>
<span class='line'>548</span>      * &lt;li>"html" -- prevents HTML injection by escaping the characters &lt &gt; and &amp;
<span class='line'>549</span>      * &lt;li>"xml" -- currently same as "html" mode
<span class='line'>550</span>      * &lt;li>"js" -- prevents breaking Javascript syntax by backslash escaping all quote and
<span class='line'>551</span>      * double-quote characters
<span class='line'>552</span>      * &lt;li>"attribute" -- meant for HTML attribute values. Currently this is the same as
<span class='line'>553</span>      * "js" escape mode.
<span class='line'>554</span>      * &lt;li>"default" -- use the type parameter from the constructor as the escape mode as well
<span class='line'>555</span>      * &lt;li>"none" or undefined -- no escaping at all.
<span class='line'>556</span>      * &lt;/ul>
<span class='line'>557</span>      *
<span class='line'>558</span>      * The type parameter of the constructor specifies what type of strings this bundle
<span class='line'>559</span>      * is operating upon. This allows pseudo-translation and automatic key generation
<span class='line'>560</span>      * to happen properly by telling this class how to parse the string. The escape mode
<span class='line'>561</span>      * for this method is different in that it specifies how this string will be used in
<span class='line'>562</span>      * the calling code and therefore how to escape it properly.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>563</span>      *
<span class='line'>564</span>      * For example, a section of Javascript code may be constructing an HTML snippet in a
<span class='line'>565</span>      * string to add to the web page. In this case, the type parameter in the constructor should
<span class='line'>566</span>      * be "html" so that the source string can be parsed properly, but the escape mode should
<span class='line'>567</span>      * be "js" so that the output string can be used in Javascript without causing syntax
<span class='line'>568</span>      * errors.
