<span class='line'> 33</span> </span><span class="COMM">/**
<span class='line'> 34</span>  * @class
<span class='line'> 35</span>  * A class that implements a locale-sensitive comparator function
<span class='line'> 36</span>  * for use with sorting function. The comparator function
<span class='line'> 37</span>  * assumes that the strings it is comparing contain Unicode characters
<span class='line'> 38</span>  * encoded in UTF-16.&lt;p>
<span class='line'> 39</span>  *
<span class='line'> 40</span>  * Collations usually depend only on the language, because most collation orders
<span class='line'> 41</span>  * are shared between locales that speak the same language. There are, however, a
<span class='line'> 42</span>  * number of instances where a locale collates differently than other locales
<span class='line'> 43</span>  * that share the same language. There are also a number of instances where a
<span class='line'> 44</span>  * locale collates differently based on the script used. This object can handle
<span class='line'> 45</span>  * these cases automatically if a full locale is specified in the options rather
<span class='line'> 46</span>  * than just a language code.&lt;p>
<span class='line'> 47</span>  *
<span class='line'> 48</span>  * &lt;h2>Options&lt;/h2>
<span class='line'> 49</span>  *
<span class='line'> 50</span>  * The options parameter can contain any of the following properties:
<span class='line'> 51</span>  *
<span class='line'> 52</span>  * &lt;ul>
<span class='line'> 53</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>locale&lt;/i> - String|Locale. The locale which the comparator function
<span class='line'> 54</span>  * will collate with. Default: the current iLib locale.
<span class='line'> 55</span>  *
<span class='line'> 56</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>sensitivity&lt;/i> - String. Sensitivity or strength of collator. This is one of
<span class='line'> 57</span>  * "primary", "base", "secondary", "accent", "tertiary", "case", "quaternary", or
<span class='line'> 58</span>  * "variant". Default: "primary"
<span class='line'> 59</span>  *   &lt;ol>
<span class='line'> 60</span>  *   &lt;li>base or primary - Only the primary distinctions between characters are significant.
<span class='line'> 61</span>  *   Another way of saying that is that the collator will be case-, accent-, and
<span class='line'> 62</span>  *   variation-insensitive, and only distinguish between the base characters
<span class='line'> 63</span>  *   &lt;li>case or secondary - Both the primary and secondary distinctions between characters
<span class='line'> 64</span>  *   are significant. That is, the collator will be accent- and variation-insensitive
<span class='line'> 65</span>  *   and will distinguish between base characters and character case.
<span class='line'> 66</span>  *   &lt;li>accent or tertiary - The primary, secondary, and tertiary distinctions between
<span class='line'> 67</span>  *   characters are all significant. That is, the collator will be
<span class='line'> 68</span>  *   variation-insensitive, but accent-, case-, and base-character-sensitive.
<span class='line'> 69</span>  *   &lt;li>variant or quaternary - All distinctions between characters are significant. That is,
<span class='line'> 70</span>  *   the algorithm is base character-, case-, accent-, and variation-sensitive.
<span class='line'> 71</span>  *   &lt;/ol>
<span class='line'> 72</span>  *
<span class='line'> 73</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>upperFirst&lt;/i> - boolean. When collating case-sensitively in a script that
<span class='line'> 74</span>  * has the concept of case, put upper-case
<span class='line'> 75</span>  * characters first, otherwise lower-case will come first. Warning: some browsers do
<span class='line'> 76</span>  * not implement this feature or at least do not implement it properly, so if you are
<span class='line'> 77</span>  * using the native collator with this option, you may get different results in different
<span class='line'> 78</span>  * browsers. To guarantee the same results, set useNative to false to use the ilib
<span class='line'> 79</span>  * collator implementation. This of course will be somewhat slower, but more
<span class='line'> 80</span>  * predictable. Default: true
<span class='line'> 81</span>  *
<span class='line'> 82</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>reverse&lt;/i> - boolean. Return the list sorted in reverse order. When the
<span class='line'> 83</span>  * upperFirst option is also set to true, upper-case characters would then come at
<span class='line'> 84</span>  * the end of the list. Default: false.
<span class='line'> 85</span>  *
<span class='line'> 86</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>scriptOrder&lt;/i> - string. When collating strings in multiple scripts,
<span class='line'> 87</span>  * this property specifies what order those scripts should be sorted. The default
<span class='line'> 88</span>  * Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) already has a default order for scripts, but
<span class='line'> 89</span>  * this can be tailored via this property. The value of this option is a
<span class='line'> 90</span>  * space-separated list of ISO 15924 scripts codes. If a code is specified in this
<span class='line'> 91</span>  * property, its default data must be included using the JS assembly tool. If the
<span class='line'> 92</span>  * data is not included, the ordering for the script will be ignored. Default:
<span class='line'> 93</span>  * the default order defined by the UCA.
<span class='line'> 94</span>  *
<span class='line'> 95</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>style&lt;/i> - The value of the style parameter is dependent on the locale.
<span class='line'> 96</span>  * For some locales, there are different styles of collating strings depending
<span class='line'> 97</span>  * on what kind of strings are being collated or what the preference of the user
<span class='line'> 98</span>  * is. For example, in German, there is a phonebook order and a dictionary ordering
<span class='line'> 99</span>  * that sort the same array of strings slightly differently.
<span class='line'>100</span>  * The static method {@link Collator#getAvailableStyles} will return a list of styles that ilib
<span class='line'>101</span>  * currently knows about for any given locale. If the value of the style option is
<span class='line'>102</span>  * not recognized for a locale, it will be ignored. Default style is "standard".&lt;p>
<span class='line'>103</span>  *
<span class='line'>104</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>usage&lt;/i> - Whether this collator will be used for searching or sorting.
<span class='line'>105</span>  * Valid values are simply the strings "sort" or "search". When used for sorting,
<span class='line'>106</span>  * it is good idea if a collator produces a stable sort. That is, the order of the
<span class='line'>107</span>  * sorted array of strings should not depend on the order of the strings in the
<span class='line'>108</span>  * input array. As such, when a collator is supposed to act case insensitively,
<span class='line'>109</span>  * it nonetheless still distinguishes between case after all other criteria
<span class='line'>110</span>  * are satisfied so that strings that are distinguished only by case do not sort
<span class='line'>111</span>  * randomly. For searching, we would like to match two strings that different only
<span class='line'>112</span>  * by case, so the collator must return equals in that situation instead of
<span class='line'>113</span>  * further distinguishing by case. Default is "sort".
<span class='line'>114</span>  *
<span class='line'>115</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>numeric&lt;/i> - Treat the left and right strings as if they started with
<span class='line'>116</span>  * numbers and sort them numerically rather than lexically.
<span class='line'>117</span>  *
<span class='line'>118</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>ignorePunctuation&lt;/i> - Skip punctuation characters when comparing the
<span class='line'>119</span>  * strings.
<span class='line'>120</span>  *
<span class='line'>121</span>  * &lt;li>onLoad - a callback function to call when the collator object is fully
<span class='line'>122</span>  * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the collator object will attempt to
<span class='line'>123</span>  * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
<span class='line'>124</span>  * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the
<span class='line'>125</span>  * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
<span class='line'>126</span>  * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
<span class='line'>127</span>  *
<span class='line'>128</span>  * &lt;li>sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or
<span class='line'>129</span>  * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
<span class='line'>130</span>  * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
<span class='line'>131</span>  * not be usable for a while.
<span class='line'>132</span>  *
<span class='line'>133</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>loadParams&lt;/i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the
<span class='line'>134</span>  * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
<span class='line'>135</span>  * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object
<span class='line'>136</span>  * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
<span class='line'>137</span>  * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
<span class='line'>138</span>  *
<span class='line'>139</span>  * &lt;li>&lt;i>useNative&lt;/i> - when this option is true, use the native Intl object
<span class='line'>140</span>  * provided by the Javascript engine, if it exists, to implement this class. If
<span class='line'>141</span>  * it doesn't exist, or if this parameter is false, then this class uses a pure
<span class='line'>142</span>  * Javascript implementation, which is slower and uses a lot more memory, but
<span class='line'>143</span>  * works everywhere that ilib works. Default is "true".
<span class='line'>144</span>  * &lt;/ul>
<span class='line'>145</span>  *
<span class='line'>146</span>  * &lt;h2>Operation&lt;/h2>
<span class='line'>147</span>  *
<span class='line'>148</span>  * The Collator constructor returns a collator object tailored with the above
<span class='line'>149</span>  * options. The object contains an internal compare() method which compares two
<span class='line'>150</span>  * strings according to those options. This can be used directly to compare
<span class='line'>151</span>  * two strings, but is not useful for passing to the javascript sort function
<span class='line'>152</span>  * because then it will not have its collation data available. Instead, use the
<span class='line'>153</span>  * getComparator() method to retrieve a function that is bound to the collator
<span class='line'>154</span>  * object. (You could also bind it yourself using ilib.bind()). The bound function
<span class='line'>155</span>  * can be used with the standard Javascript array sorting algorithm, or as a
<span class='line'>156</span>  * comparator with your own sorting algorithm.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>157</span>  *
<span class='line'>158</span>  * Example using the standard Javascript array sorting call with the bound
<span class='line'>159</span>  * function:&lt;p>
<span class='line'>160</span>  *
<span class='line'>161</span>  * &lt;code>
<span class='line'>162</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>163</span>  * var arr = ["ö", "oe", "ü", "o", "a", "ae", "u", "ß", "ä"];
<span class='line'>164</span>  * var collator = new Collator({locale: 'de-DE', style: "dictionary"});
<span class='line'>165</span>  * arr.sort(collator.getComparator());
<span class='line'>166</span>  * console.log(JSON.stringify(arr));
<span class='line'>167</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>168</span>  * &lt;/code>
<span class='line'>169</span>  * &lt;p>
<span class='line'>170</span>  *
<span class='line'>171</span>  * Would give the output:&lt;p>
<span class='line'>172</span>  *
<span class='line'>173</span>  * &lt;code>
<span class='line'>174</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>175</span>  * ["a", "ae", "ä", "o", "oe", "ö", "ß", "u", "ü"]
<span class='line'>176</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>177</span>  * &lt;/code>
<span class='line'>178</span>  *
<span class='line'>179</span>  * When sorting an array of Javascript objects according to one of the
<span class='line'>180</span>  * string properties of the objects, wrap the collator's compare function
<span class='line'>181</span>  * in your own comparator function that knows the structure of the objects
<span class='line'>182</span>  * being sorted:&lt;p>
<span class='line'>183</span>  *
<span class='line'>184</span>  * &lt;code>
<span class='line'>185</span>  * &lt;pre>
<span class='line'>186</span>  * var collator = new Collator({locale: 'de-DE'});
<span class='line'>187</span>  * var myComparator = function (collator) {
<span class='line'>188</span>  *   var comparator = collator.getComparator();
<span class='line'>189</span>  *   // left and right are your own objects
<span class='line'>190</span>  *   return function (left, right) {
<span class='line'>191</span>  *       return comparator(left.x.y.textProperty, right.x.y.textProperty);
<span class='line'>192</span>  *   };
<span class='line'>193</span>  * };
<span class='line'>194</span>  * arr.sort(myComparator(collator));
<span class='line'>195</span>  * &lt;/pre>
<span class='line'>196</span>  * &lt;/code>
<span class='line'>197</span>  * &lt;p>
<span class='line'>198</span>  *
<span class='line'>199</span>  * &lt;h2>Sort Keys&lt;/h2>
<span class='line'>200</span>  *
<span class='line'>201</span>  * The collator class also has a method to retrieve the sort key for a
<span class='line'>202</span>  * string. The sort key is an array of values that represent how each
<span class='line'>203</span>  * character in the string should be collated according to the characteristics
<span class='line'>204</span>  * of the collation algorithm and the given options. Thus, sort keys can be
<span class='line'>205</span>  * compared directly value-for-value with other sort keys that were generated
<span class='line'>206</span>  * by the same collator, and the resulting ordering is guaranteed to be the
<span class='line'>207</span>  * same as if the original strings were compared by the collator.
<span class='line'>208</span>  * Sort keys generated by different collators are not guaranteed to give
<span class='line'>209</span>  * any reasonable results when compared together unless the two collators
<span class='line'>210</span>  * were constructed with
<span class='line'>211</span>  * exactly the same options and therefore end up representing the exact same
<span class='line'>212</span>  * collation sequence.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>213</span>  *
<span class='line'>214</span>  * A good rule of thumb is that you would use a sort key if you had 10 or more
<span class='line'>215</span>  * items to sort or if your array might be resorted arbitrarily. For example, if your
<span class='line'>216</span>  * user interface was displaying a table with 100 rows in it, and each row had
<span class='line'>217</span>  * 4 sortable text columns which could be sorted in acending or descending order,
<span class='line'>218</span>  * the recommended practice would be to generate a sort key for each of the 4
<span class='line'>219</span>  * sortable fields in each row and store that in the Javascript representation of the
<span class='line'>220</span>  * table data. Then, when the user clicks on a column header to resort the
<span class='line'>221</span>  * table according to that column, the resorting would be relatively quick
<span class='line'>222</span>  * because it would only be comparing arrays of values, and not recalculating
<span class='line'>223</span>  * the collation values for each character in each string for every comparison.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>224</span>  *
<span class='line'>225</span>  * For tables that are large, it is usually a better idea to do the sorting
<span class='line'>226</span>  * on the server side, especially if the table is the result of a database
<span class='line'>227</span>  * query. In this case, the table is usually a view of the cursor of a large
<span class='line'>228</span>  * results set, and only a few entries are sent to the front end at a time.
<span class='line'>229</span>  * In order to sort the set efficiently, it should be done on the database
<span class='line'>230</span>  * level instead.
<span class='line'>231</span>  *
<span class='line'>232</span>  * &lt;h2>Data&lt;/h2>
<span class='line'>233</span>  *
<span class='line'>234</span>  * Doing correct collation entails a huge amount of mapping data, much of which is
<span class='line'>235</span>  * not necessary when collating in one language with one script, which is the most
<span class='line'>236</span>  * common case. Thus, ilib implements a number of ways to include the data you
<span class='line'>237</span>  * need or leave out the data you don't need using the JS assembly tool:
<span class='line'>238</span>  *
<span class='line'>239</span>  * &lt;ol>
<span class='line'>240</span>  * &lt;li>Full multilingual data - if you are sorting multilingual data and need to collate
<span class='line'>241</span>  * text written in multiple scripts, you can use the directive "!data collation/ducet" to
<span class='line'>242</span>  * load in the full collation data.  This allows the collator to perform the entire
<span class='line'>243</span>  * Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) based on the Default Unicode Collation Element
<span class='line'>244</span>  * Table (DUCET). The data is very large, on the order of multiple megabytes, but
<span class='line'>245</span>  * sometimes it is necessary.
<span class='line'>246</span>  * &lt;li>A few scripts - if you are sorting text written in only a few scripts, you may
<span class='line'>247</span>  * want to include only the data for those scripts. Each ISO 15924 script code has its
<span class='line'>248</span>  * own data available in a separate file, so you can use the data directive to include
<span class='line'>249</span>  * only the data for the scripts you need. For example, use
<span class='line'>250</span>  * "!data collation/Latn" to retrieve the collation information for the Latin script.
<span class='line'>251</span>  * Because the "ducet" table mentioned in the previous point is a superset of the
<span class='line'>252</span>  * tables for all other scripts, you do not need to include explicitly the data for
<span class='line'>253</span>  * any particular script when using "ducet". That is, you either include "ducet" or
<span class='line'>254</span>  * you include a specific list of scripts.
<span class='line'>255</span>  * &lt;li>Only one script - if you are sorting text written only in one script, you can
<span class='line'>256</span>  * either include the data directly as in the previous point, or you can rely on the
<span class='line'>257</span>  * locale to include the correct data for you. In this case, you can use the directive
<span class='line'>258</span>  * "!data collate" to load in the locale's collation data for its most common script.
<span class='line'>259</span>  * &lt;/ol>
<span class='line'>260</span>  *
<span class='line'>261</span>  * With any of the above ways of including the data, the collator will only perform the
<span class='line'>262</span>  * correct language-sensitive sorting for the given locale. All other scripts will be
<span class='line'>263</span>  * sorted in the default manner according to the UCA. For example, if you include the
<span class='line'>264</span>  * "ducet" data and pass in "de-DE" (German for Germany) as the locale spec, then
<span class='line'>265</span>  * only the Latin script (the default script for German) will be sorted according to
<span class='line'>266</span>  * German rules. All other scripts in the DUCET, such as Japanese or Arabic, will use
<span class='line'>267</span>  * the default UCA collation rules.&lt;p>
<span class='line'>268</span>  *
<span class='line'>269</span>  * If this collator encounters a character for which it has no collation data, it will
<span class='line'>270</span>  * sort those characters by pure Unicode value after all characters for which it does have
<span class='line'>271</span>  * collation data. For example, if you only loaded in the German collation data (ie. the
<span class='line'>272</span>  * data for the Latin script tailored to German) to sort a list of person names, but that
<span class='line'>273</span>  * list happens to include the names of a few Japanese people written in Japanese
<span class='line'>274</span>  * characters, the Japanese names will sort at the end of the list after all German names,
<span class='line'>275</span>  * and will sort according to the Unicode values of the characters.
<span class='line'>276</span>  *
