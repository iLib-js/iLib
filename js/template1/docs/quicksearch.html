The options parameter can be an object that contains the following properties: type - specify the type of the calendar desired. The list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those calendars you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register themselves with this factory method. The \"official\", \"gregorian\", and \"julian\" calendars are all included by default, as they are the standard calendars for much of the world. locale - some calendars vary depending on the locale. For example, the \"official\" calendar transitions from a Julian-style calendar to a Gregorian-style calendar on a different date for each country, as the governments of those countries decided to adopt the Gregorian calendar at different times. onLoad - a callback function to call when the calendar object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the calendar factory will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If a locale is specified, but no type, then the calendar that is default for the locale will be instantiated and returned. If neither the type nor the locale are specified, then the calendar for the default locale will be used. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type Type Calendar CharmapFactory( [options]) Factory method to create a new instance of a character set mapping (charmap) subclass that is appropriate for the requested charset. Charmap instances map strings to other character sets. The charsets can be of any type, single-byte, multi-byte, shifting, etc. All mappings are done to or from Unicode in the UTF-16 encoding, which is the base character set and encoding used by Javascript itself. In order to convert between two non-Unicode character sets, you must chain two charmap instances together to first map to Unicode and then back to the second charset. The options parameter controls which mapping is constructed and its behaviours. The current list of supported options are: name - the name of the native charset to map to or from. This can be given as an Charset instance or as a string that contains any commonly used name for the character set, which is normalized to a standard IANA name. If a name is not given, this class will default to the Western European character set called ISO-8859-15. missing - specify what to do if a mapping is missing for a particular character. For example, if you are mapping Unicode characters to a particular native character set that does not support particular Unicode characters, the mapper will follow the behaviour specified in this property. Valid values are: skip - skip any characters that do not exist in the target charset placeholder - put a static placeholder character in the output string wherever there is an unknown character in the input string. Use the placeholder parameter to specify which character to use in this case escape - use an escape sequence to represent the unknown character The default value for the missing property if not otherwise specified is \"escape\" so that information is not lost. placeholder - specify the placeholder character to use when the mapper cannot map a particular input character to the output string. If this option is not specified, then the '?' (question mark) character is used where possible. escapeStyle - what style of escape sequences should be used to escape unknown characters in the input when mapping to native, and what style of espcae sequences should be parsed when mapping to Unicode. Valid values are: html - Escape the characters as HTML entities. This would use the standard HTML 5.0 (or later) entity names where possible, and numeric entities in all other cases. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"é\" js - Use the Javascript escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c#\" as it uses a similar escape syntax. c - Use the C/C++ escape style, which is similar to the the Javascript style, but uses an \"x\" in place of the \"u\". Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\x00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c++\". java - Use the Java escape style. This is very similar to the the Javascript style, but the backslash has to be escaped twice. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"ruby\", as Ruby uses a similar escape syntax with double backslashes. perl - Use the Perl escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\N{U+00E9}\" The default if this style is not specified is \"js\" for Javascript. onLoad - a callback function to call when this object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, because the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done. If the onLoad option is not given, this class will only attempt to load any missing data synchronously. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a character set mapping class appropriate for the requested charset, or undefined if no mapper could be found that supports the requested charset Type Charmap | undefined DateFactory( [options]) Factory method to create a new instance of a date subclass. The options parameter can be an object that contains the following properties: type - specify the type/calendar of the date desired. The list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those date type you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register themselves with this factory method. The \"gregorian\", and \"julian\" calendars are all included by default, as they are the standard calendars for much of the world. If not specified, the type of the date returned is the one that is appropriate for the locale. This property may also be given as \"calendar\" instead of \"type\". onLoad - a callback function to call when the date object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the date factory will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. The options object is also passed down to the date constructor, and thus can contain the the properties as the date object being instantiated. See the documentation for GregorianDate, and other subclasses for more details on other parameter that may be passed in. Please note that if you do not give the type parameter, this factory method will create a date object that is appropriate for the calendar that is most commonly used in the specified or current ilib locale. For example, in Thailand, the most common calendar is the Thai solar calendar. If the current locale is \"th-TH\" (Thai for Thailand) and you use this factory method to construct a new date without specifying the type, it will automatically give you back an instance of ThaiSolarDate. This is convenient because you do not need to know which locales use which types of dates. In fact, you should always use this factory method to make new date instances unless you know that you specifically need a date in a particular calendar. Also note that when you pass in the date components such as year, month, day, etc., these components should be appropriate for the given date being instantiated. That is, in our Thai example in the previous paragraph, the year and such should be given as a Thai solar year, not the Gregorian year that you get from the Javascript Date class. In order to initialize a date instance when you don't know what subclass will be instantiated for the locale, use a parameter such as \"unixtime\" or \"julianday\" which are unambiguous and based on UTC time, instead of the year/month/date date components. The date components for that UTC time will be calculated and the time zone offset will be automatically factored in. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type Type IDate MeasurementFactory( [options]) Create a measurement subclass instance based on a particular measure required. The measurement is immutable once it is created, but it can be converted to other measurements later. The options may contain any of the following properties: amount - either a numeric amount for this measurement given as a number of the specified units, or another Measurement instance to convert to the requested units. If converting to new units, the type of measure between the other instance's units and the current units must be the same. That is, you can only convert one unit of mass to another. You cannot convert a unit of mass into a unit of length. unit - units of this measurement. Use the static call MeasurementFactory.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. If the given unit is not a base unit, the amount will be normalized to the number of base units and stored as that number of base units. For example, if an instance is constructed with 1 kg, this will be converted automatically into 1000 g, as grams are the base unit and kg is merely a commonly used scale of grams. Here are some examples of converting a length into new units. The first method is via this factory function by passing the old measurement in as the \"amount\" property. var measurement1 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: 5, units: \"kilometers\" }); var measurement2 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: measurement1, units: \"miles\" }); The value in measurement2 will end up being about 3.125 miles. The second method uses the convert method. var measurement1 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: 5, units: \"kilometers\" }); var measurement2 = measurement1.convert(\"miles\"); }); The value in measurement2 will again end up being about 3.125 miles.

The options parameter can be an object that contains the following properties: type - specify the type of the calendar desired. The list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those calendars you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register themselves with this factory method. The \"official\", \"gregorian\", and \"julian\" calendars are all included by default, as they are the standard calendars for much of the world. locale - some calendars vary depending on the locale. For example, the \"official\" calendar transitions from a Julian-style calendar to a Gregorian-style calendar on a different date for each country, as the governments of those countries decided to adopt the Gregorian calendar at different times. onLoad - a callback function to call when the calendar object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the calendar factory will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If a locale is specified, but no type, then the calendar that is default for the locale will be instantiated and returned. If neither the type nor the locale are specified, then the calendar for the default locale will be used. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type Type Calendar CharmapFactory( [options]) Factory method to create a new instance of a character set mapping (charmap) subclass that is appropriate for the requested charset. Charmap instances map strings to other character sets. The charsets can be of any type, single-byte, multi-byte, shifting, etc. All mappings are done to or from Unicode in the UTF-16 encoding, which is the base character set and encoding used by Javascript itself. In order to convert between two non-Unicode character sets, you must chain two charmap instances together to first map to Unicode and then back to the second charset. The options parameter controls which mapping is constructed and its behaviours. The current list of supported options are: name - the name of the native charset to map to or from. This can be given as an Charset instance or as a string that contains any commonly used name for the character set, which is normalized to a standard IANA name. If a name is not given, this class will default to the Western European character set called ISO-8859-15. missing - specify what to do if a mapping is missing for a particular character. For example, if you are mapping Unicode characters to a particular native character set that does not support particular Unicode characters, the mapper will follow the behaviour specified in this property. Valid values are: skip - skip any characters that do not exist in the target charset placeholder - put a static placeholder character in the output string wherever there is an unknown character in the input string. Use the placeholder parameter to specify which character to use in this case escape - use an escape sequence to represent the unknown character The default value for the missing property if not otherwise specified is \"escape\" so that information is not lost. placeholder - specify the placeholder character to use when the mapper cannot map a particular input character to the output string. If this option is not specified, then the '?' (question mark) character is used where possible. escapeStyle - what style of escape sequences should be used to escape unknown characters in the input when mapping to native, and what style of espcae sequences should be parsed when mapping to Unicode. Valid values are: html - Escape the characters as HTML entities. This would use the standard HTML 5.0 (or later) entity names where possible, and numeric entities in all other cases. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"é\" js - Use the Javascript escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c#\" as it uses a similar escape syntax. c - Use the C/C++ escape style, which is similar to the the Javascript style, but uses an \"x\" in place of the \"u\". Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\x00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c++\". java - Use the Java escape style. This is very similar to the the Javascript style, but the backslash has to be escaped twice. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"ruby\", as Ruby uses a similar escape syntax with double backslashes. perl - Use the Perl escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\N{U+00E9}\" The default if this style is not specified is \"js\" for Javascript. onLoad - a callback function to call when this object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, because the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done. If the onLoad option is not given, this class will only attempt to load any missing data synchronously. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a character set mapping class appropriate for the requested charset, or undefined if no mapper could be found that supports the requested charset Type Charmap | undefined DateFactory( [options]) Factory method to create a new instance of a date subclass. The options parameter can be an object that contains the following properties: type - specify the type/calendar of the date desired. The list of valid values changes depending on which calendars are defined. When assembling your iliball.js, include those date type you wish to use in your program or web page, and they will register themselves with this factory method. The \"gregorian\", and \"julian\" calendars are all included by default, as they are the standard calendars for much of the world. If not specified, the type of the date returned is the one that is appropriate for the locale. This property may also be given as \"calendar\" instead of \"type\". onLoad - a callback function to call when the date object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the date factory will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. The options object is also passed down to the date constructor, and thus can contain the the properties as the date object being instantiated. See the documentation for GregorianDate, and other subclasses for more details on other parameter that may be passed in. Please note that if you do not give the type parameter, this factory method will create a date object that is appropriate for the calendar that is most commonly used in the specified or current ilib locale. For example, in Thailand, the most common calendar is the Thai solar calendar. If the current locale is \"th-TH\" (Thai for Thailand) and you use this factory method to construct a new date without specifying the type, it will automatically give you back an instance of ThaiSolarDate. This is convenient because you do not need to know which locales use which types of dates. In fact, you should always use this factory method to make new date instances unless you know that you specifically need a date in a particular calendar. Also note that when you pass in the date components such as year, month, day, etc., these components should be appropriate for the given date being instantiated. That is, in our Thai example in the previous paragraph, the year and such should be given as a Thai solar year, not the Gregorian year that you get from the Javascript Date class. In order to initialize a date instance when you don't know what subclass will be instantiated for the locale, use a parameter such as \"unixtime\" or \"julianday\" which are unambiguous and based on UTC time, instead of the year/month/date date components. The date components for that UTC time will be calculated and the time zone offset will be automatically factored in. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options controlling the construction of this instance, or undefined to use the default options Returns: an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type Type IDate MeasurementFactory( [options]) Create a measurement subclass instance based on a particular measure required. The measurement is immutable once it is created, but it can be converted to other measurements later. The options may contain any of the following properties: amount - either a numeric amount for this measurement given as a number of the specified units, or another Measurement instance to convert to the requested units. If converting to new units, the type of measure between the other instance's units and the current units must be the same. That is, you can only convert one unit of mass to another. You cannot convert a unit of mass into a unit of length. unit - units of this measurement. Use the static call MeasurementFactory.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. If the given unit is not a base unit, the amount will be normalized to the number of base units and stored as that number of base units. For example, if an instance is constructed with 1 kg, this will be converted automatically into 1000 g, as grams are the base unit and kg is merely a commonly used scale of grams. Here are some examples of converting a length into new units. The first method is via this factory function by passing the old measurement in as the \"amount\" property. var measurement1 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: 5, units: \"kilometers\" }); var measurement2 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: measurement1, units: \"miles\" }); The value in measurement2 will end up being about 3.125 miles. The second method uses the convert method. var measurement1 = MeasurementFactory({ amount: 5, units: \"kilometers\" }); var measurement2 = measurement1.convert(\"miles\"); }); The value in measurement2 will again end up being about 3.125 miles.

It does not require any other libraries to function, and can run equally well in various older and newer browsers, on various OS's (including mobile), nodejs, webOS, Qt/QML, RingoJS, React/Enact, or rhino/nashorn. More elaborate documentation can be found here What Can iLib Do? iLib contains many classes that cover a large number of i18n topics, a lot more than almost all other JS i18n libraries. String translation (ResBundle) String formatting, including plurals/choice formats (IString) Character type functions (like the C/C++ ctype functions) (CType) Calendars (CalendarFactory) Gregorian, Julian, ThaiSolar, Persian algorithmic, Persian astronomical, Hebrew, Arabic civil, Ethiopic, Coptic, Chinese Han Date and time representation and conversion to other calendars (DateFactory) Date and time formatting in all calendars, including full time zone support (DateFmt) Time zone information from IANA TZ database (TimeZone) Duration formatting for lengths of events, videos, music, etc. (DurationFmt) Date range formatting with specific start and end times (DateRngFmt) Unicode character normalization using the Unicode Normalization Algorithm (NormString) Also supports full character iteration (as opposed to Unicode character iteration) Unicode glyph string iteration (GlyphString) Number parsing (INumber) and numeric formatting, including percentages and currencies (NumFmt) Units conversion, scaling, and formatting (lengths, volumes, temperature, velocity, etc.) (Measurement and UnitFmt) Phone number parsing and normalization (PhoneNumber), geo-location (PhoneGeoLocator), and formatting (PhoneFmt) Personal name parsing (Name) and formatting (NameFmt) Mailing address parsing (Address) and formatting (AddressFmt) Collation/sorting and sortkey generation (Collator) Locale-sensitive upper- and lower-casing (CaseMapper) Information about writing systems/scripts (ScriptInfo) Information about currencies (Currency) Information about locale settings such as default time zone, default calendar, use of 12 or 24-hour clock, List formatting such as \"Joe, Tom, and Steve\" (ListFormatter) Alphabetic index keeping. For example, it can be used to put names on a contact list into their corresponding letter buckets (AlphabeticIndex) plus a lot more. Only need some of that? That's okay, there's a way to make smaller versions of ilib that only include the classes you need and only the locales you need using webpack. What Locales Does it Support? In short: almost any that you can think of. For most classes, it supports all locales that are in the Unicode CLDR (see http://cldr.unicode.org), which means hundreds. Since language settings are separate from region settings, the arbitrary combinations of those can reach well into the thousands. For those classes of information where CLDR does not have info yet (such as phone formats), there is a much smaller set of locales that are supported, but for all classes, the top most used locales on the Internet are represented. Where Does it Run? ILib has been tested in the following environments: nodejs 0.10+ Browsers: Chrome 28+ Firefox 35+ Opera 12.16+ Safari 6+ Internet Explorer 8+ Rhino on JDK 1.7+ and 1.8 with Trireme (0.8.5) RingoJS 0.11+ Qt 5.4+ Those environments have been tested on the following platforms where possible: Ubuntu 12.04+ Windows 7 &amp; 8 Mac OSX 10.04+ Android iOS Example of Using iLib Under NodeJS or RingoJS iLib is a regular node module and can therefore be loaded using the built-in nodejs require() function. Here is an example of using iLib to format the current date/time for Berlin, Germany. This same example works equally well with ringojs running on rhino in a Java-based app server. var DateFactory = require(\"ilib/lib/DateFactory.js\"); var DateFmt = require(\"ilib/lib/DateFmt.js\"); var d = DateFactory(); var f = new DateFmt({ locale: \"de-DE\", type: \"datetime\", length: \"long\", timezone: \"Europe/Berlin\" }); f.format(d); Result would be: '07:45 06. Nov. 2014' Other iLib Support Prepackaged iLib If you would like to run ilib in your webapp, you can use the pre-webpacked versions of ilib in the releases page on github. Webpack If you already use webpack for your own project, you can use the ilib webpack loader and plugin to include ilib code and locale data into your own webpacked project. The advantage is that it will only include those ilib classes you are actually using and only the locale data for the locales you specify. That helps to minimize the file size of your webpack chunks. See the README documentation in the ilib webpack loader for more details. No Webpack If you do not use webpack for your own project, and yet you still want a minimal version of ilib, you can use the ilib scanner to scan your webapp code and create a webpack config that will build this minimal version for you. You can just include the resulting js files in your webapp. See the README for that project for details. React If you are using React in your project and would like to include ilib classes, you can use the webpack loader and plugin mentioned above to do so. Additionally, there is a new library of React components called react-ilib that will eventually allow you to use all the ilib formatters as React components, such as an address formatting component that will output an address in the correct format per locale. It says \"eventually\" in the previous sentence because the project is new and there is a lot left to code. React-ilib will also include a number of new components that allow you to do localized input form elements. For example, a localized address form component will present all of the fields necessary for an address in a number of different locales, along with the localized field labels and placeholder texts. The result of a user filling out the form would be an ilib Address instance, ready to use! ES6 If you want to use ilib classes directly from ES6 instead of using React components, you can do that with the ilib-es6 project. With this library, you can use ilib asynchronously with promises instead of node-style callbacks, and you can import the classes in regular ES6 style. This library also works nicely in React if you want to call the ilib classes directly instead of using react-ilib components. Localizing Your Strings If you use ilib in your javascript project, you can use the loctool to extract the strings into XLIFF files that your translation vendor can translate directly. When you received the localized XLIFF files back again, you can then run the loctool again to generate localized assets, such as resource files that ilib's ResBundle class can use, or copies of HTML files with localized text in them. See the loctool documentation for more information. Where to Get it For node, you can simply install it using npm or yarn: npm install ilib yarn add ilib For ringojs, you can install it with the ringo package manager: rp install ilib ILib is also available on github at https://github.com/iLib-js/iLib or official iLib builds in tar balls at https://github.com/iLib-js/iLib/releases You can also build your own version from the sources using webpack.

This function parses a physical address written in a free-form string. It returns an object with a number of properties from the list below that it may have extracted from that address. The following is a list of properties that the algorithm will return: streetAddress: The street address, including house numbers and all. locality: The locality of this address (usually a city or town). region: The region where the locality is located. In the US, this corresponds to states. In other countries, this may be provinces, cantons, prefectures, etc. In some smaller countries, there are no such divisions. postalCode: Country-specific code for expediting mail. In the US, this is the zip code. country: The country of the address. countryCode: The ISO 3166 2-letter region code for the destination country in this address. The above properties will not necessarily appear in the instance. For any individual property, if the free-form address does not contain that property or it cannot be parsed out, the it is left out. The options parameter may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale or localeSpec to use to parse the address. If not specified, this function will use the current ilib locale onLoad - a callback function to call when the address info for the locale is fully loaded and the address has been parsed. When the onLoad option is given, the address object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. When an address cannot be parsed properly, the entire address will be placed into the streetAddress property. When the freeformAddress is another Address, this will act like a copy constructor. new Address(freeformAddress, options) Parameters: Name Type Description freeformAddress string | Address free-form address to parse, or a javascript object containing the fields options Object options to the parser Members country :string|undefined The country of the address.

The options object may contain the following properties, both of which are optional: locale - the locale to use to format this address. If not specified, it uses the default locale style - the style of this address. The default style for each country usually includes all valid fields for that country. onLoad - a callback function to call when the address info for the locale is fully loaded and the address has been parsed. When the onLoad option is given, the address formatter object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new AddressFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options that configure how this formatter should work Returns a formatter instance that can format multiple addresses. Methods format(address) This function formats a physical address (Address instance) for display. Whitespace is trimmed from the beginning and end of final resulting string, and multiple consecutive whitespace characters in the middle of the string are compressed down to 1 space character. If the Address instance is for a locale that is different than the locale for this formatter, then a hybrid address is produced. The country name is located in the correct spot for the current formatter's locale, but the rest of the fields are formatted according to the default style of the locale of the actual address. Example: a mailing address in China, but formatted for the US might produce the words \"People's Republic of China\" in English at the last line of the address, and the Chinese-style address will appear in the first line of the address. In the US, the country is on the last line, but in China the country is usually on the first line. Parameters: Name Type Description address Address Address to format Returns: Returns a string containing the formatted address Type string getFormatInfo(locale [, sync] [, callback]) Return information about the address format that can be used by UI builders to display a locale-sensitive set of input fields based on the current formatter's settings. The object returned by this method is an array of address rows. Each row is itself an array which may have one to four address components in that row. Each address component is an object that contains a component property and a label to display with it. The label is written in the given locale, or the locale of this formatter if it was not given. Optionally, if the address component is constrained to a particular pattern or to a fixed list of possible values, then the constraint rules are given in the \"constraint\" property. If an address component must conform to a particular pattern, the regular expression that matches that pattern is returned in \"constraint\". Mostly, it is only the postal code component that can be validated in this way. If an address component should be limited to a fixed list of values, then the constraint property will be set to an array that lists those values. The constraint contains an array of objects in the correct sorted order for the locale where each object contains an code property containing the ISO code, and a name field to show in UI. The ISO codes should not be shown to the user and are intended to represent the values in code. The names are translated to the given locale or to the locale of this formatter if it was not given. For the most part, it is the region and country components that are constrained in this way. Here is what the result would look like for a US address: [ [{ \"component\": \"streetAddress\", \"label\": \"Street Address\" }], [{ \"component\": \"locality\", \"label\": \"City\" },{ \"component\": \"region\", \"label\": \"State\", \"constraint\": [{ \"code\": \"AL\", \"name\": \"Alabama\" },{ \"code\": \"AK\", \"name\": \"Alaska\" },{ ... },{ \"code\": \"WY\", \"name\": \"Wyoming\" } },{ \"component\": \"postalCode\", \"label\": \"Zip Code\", \"constraint\": \"[0-9]{5}(-[0-9]{4})?\" }], [{ \"component\": \"country\", \"label\": \"Country\", \"constraint\": [{ \"code\": \"AF\", \"name\": \"Afghanistan\" },{ \"code\": \"AL\", \"name\": \"Albania\" },{ ... },{ \"code\": \"ZW\", \"name\": \"Zimbabwe\" }] }] ] Parameters: Name Type Argument Description locale Locale | string the locale to translate the labels to. If not given, the locale of the formatter will be used. sync boolean &lt;optional&gt; true if this method should load the data synchronously, false if async callback function &lt;optional&gt; a callback to call when the data is ready Returns: An array of rows of address components Type Array.&lt;Object&gt; Example Example of calling the getFormatInfo method // the AddressFmt should be created with the locale of the address you // would like the user to enter. For example, if you have a \"country\" // selector, you would create a new AddressFmt instance each time the // selector is changed. new AddressFmt({ locale: 'nl-NL', // for addresses in the Netherlands onLoad: ilib.bind(this, function(fmt) { // The following is the locale of the UI you would like to see the labels // like \"City\" and \"Postal Code\" translated to. In this example, we // are showing an input form for Dutch addresses, but the labels are // written in US English. fmt.getAddressFormatInfo(\"en-US\", true, ilib.bind(this, function(rows) { // iterate through the rows array and dynamically create the input // elements with the given labels })); }) }); × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This class handles alphabetic indexes which are collated sequences of buckets into which elements are placed, sorted appropriate to the given language. An example would be an index of person names in a contact list, organized by the first letter of the family name. Example in English: Buckets: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z # A Adams Albers Alvarez B Baker Banerjee Brunshteyn ... This class can give you the sorted list of labels to show in the UI. It can also organize a list of string elements into buckets for each label so that you can display the correctly sorted elements. This depends on the Collator class to perform the sorting/collation. The class also supports having buckets for strings before the first (underflow) and after the last (overflow) bucket. If you have a lot of characters that are not commonly used in the current locale, you can add more labels for those characters as well. Elements will match those buckets only if they have the same first character as the bucket label. The options object may contain any (or none) of the following properties: locale - locale or localeSpec to use to parse the address. If not specified, this function will use the current ilib locale style - the style of collation to use for this index. For some locales, there are different styles of collating strings depending on what kind of strings are being collated or what the preference of the user is. For example, in German, there is a phonebook order and a dictionary ordering that sort the same array of strings slightly differently. The static method Collator#getAvailableStyles will return a list of collation styles that ilib currently knows about for any given locale. If the value of the style option is not recognized for a locale, it will be ignored. Default style is \"standard\". overflowLabel - the label to use for the overflow bucket. Default: \"#\" underflowLabel - the label to use for the underflow bucket. Default: \"*\" onLoad - a callback function to call when the address info for the locale is fully loaded and the index is ready to be used. When the onLoad option is given, the alphabetic index object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new AlphabeticIndex(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options to the parser Methods addElement(element) Add an element to the index. The element is added to the appropriate bucket and sorted within that bucket according to the collation for the locale set up within this index. Parameters: Name Type Description element string | undefined the element to add Returns: the label of the bucket into which this element was added Type string | undefined addLabels(labels [, start]) Add labels to this index for characters that are not commonly used in the current locale. These are added into the list of bucket labels at the given start index. If start is not given, or is not within the range of 0 (the overflow bucket) to N (the underflow bucket), then the default position is at the end of the list right before the underflow bucket. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description labels Array.&lt;string&gt; array of labels to add in the order you would like to see them returned start number &lt;optional&gt; the position in the bucket labels list to add these new labels clear() Clear all elements from the buckets. This index can be reused for a new batch of elements by clearing it first. getAllBucketLabels() Return the all the bucket labels typically used in the locale. This includes all bucket labels, even if those buckets do not contain any elements. Returns: the array of bucket labels for this index in collation order Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getAllBuckets() Return a javascript hash containing all elements in the index. The hash has a property for each bucket, and the value of the property is an array of elements. Example: [ { label: \"A\", elements: [ \"A\", \"Aachen\", \"Adams\", ... ] }, { label: \"B\", elements: [\"B\", \"Baaa\", \"Boo\"] }, ... { label: \"#\", elements: [\"3par.com\", \"@handle\"] } ] All elements within a bucket are sorted per the collation for the locale of this index. Returns: a hash of all buckets and elements as per the description above. Type Object getBucket(element) Return the label of the bucket for a given element. This follows the rules set up when the index was instantiated to find the bucket into which the element would go if it were added to this index. The element is not added to the index, however. (See addElement for that.) Parameters: Name Type Description element string | undefined the element to check Returns: the label for the bucket for this element Type string | undefined getBucketCount() Return the total number of buckets in this index. Returns: the number of buckets in this index Type number getBucketLabels() Return the bucket labels for this index in order.

Parameters: Name Type Description to string the name of the units to convert this measurement to Inherited From: Measurement#convert Returns: the amount corresponding to the requested unit Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;optional&gt; object containing a mapping between the measurement system and an array of units to use to restrict the expansion to constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#expand Returns: an array of new measurements in order from the current units to the smallest units in the system which together are the same measurement as this one Type Array.&lt;Measurement&gt; getAmount() Return the numeric amount of this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the system to scale to units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling. If this is not defined, this measurement type will use the set of units that it knows about for the given measurement system Inherited From: Measurement#scale Returns: a new instance that is scaled to the right level Type Measurement &lt;static&gt; convert(to, from, area) Convert a Area to another measure. Parameters: Name Type Description to string unit to convert to from string unit to convert from area number amount to be convert Returns: the converted amount Type number | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This class is the parent class of all of the charmapping subclasses, and only implements basic US-ASCII mapping. The subclasses implement all other charsets, some algorithmically, and some in a table-based way. Use CharmapFactory to create the correct subclass instance for the desired charmap. All mappings are done to or from Unicode in the UTF-16 encoding, which is the base character set and encoding used by Javascript itself. In order to convert between two non-Unicode character sets, you must chain two charmap instances together to first map to Unicode and then back to the second charset. The options parameter controls which mapping is constructed and its behaviours. The current list of supported options are: missing - specify what to do if a mapping is missing for a particular character. For example, if you are mapping Unicode characters to a particular native character set that does not support particular Unicode characters, the mapper will follow the behaviour specified in this property. Valid values are: skip - skip any characters that do not exist in the target charset placeholder - put a static placeholder character in the output string wherever there is an unknown character in the input string. Use the placeholder parameter to specify which character to use in this case escape - use an escape sequence to represent the unknown character The default value for the missing property if not otherwise specified is \"escape\" so that information is not lost. placeholder - specify the placeholder character to use when the mapper cannot map a particular input character to the output string. If this option is not specified, then the '?' (question mark) character is used where possible. escapeStyle - what style of escape sequences should be used to escape unknown characters in the input when mapping to native, and what style of espcae sequences should be parsed when mapping to Unicode. Valid values are: html - Escape the characters as HTML entities. This would use the standard HTML 5.0 (or later) entity names where possible, and numeric entities in all other cases. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"é\" js - Use the Javascript escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c#\" as it uses a similar escape syntax. c - Use the C/C++ escape style, which is similar to the the Javascript style, but uses an \"x\" in place of the \"u\". Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\x00E9\". This can also be specified as \"c++\". java - Use the Java escape style. This is very similar to the the Javascript style, but the backslash has to be escaped twice. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\\\u00E9\". This can also be specified as \"ruby\", as Ruby uses a similar escape syntax with double backslashes. perl - Use the Perl escape style. Eg. an \"e\" with an acute accent would be \"\\N{U+00E9}\" The default if this style is not specified is \"js\" for Javascript. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done. If the onLoad option is not given, this class will only attempt to load any missing data synchronously. new Charmap( [options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; options which govern the construction of this instance Methods getName() Return the standard name of this charmap. All charmaps map from Unicode to the native charset, so the name returned from this function corresponds to the native charset. Returns: the name of the locale's language in English Type string mapToNative(string) Map a string to the native character set. This string may be given as an intrinsic Javascript string object or an IString object. Parameters: Name Type Description string string | IString string to map to a different character set. Returns: An array of bytes representing the string in the native character set Type Uint8Array mapToUnicode(bytes) Map a native string to the standard Javascript charset of UTF-16.

The options parameter controls which mapping is constructed and its behaviours. The current list of supported options are: charset - the name of the native charset to map to or from. This can be given as an Charset instance or as a string that contains any commonly used name for the character set, which is normalized to a standard IANA name. If a name is not given, this class will default to the Western European character set called ISO-8859-15. missing - specify what to do if a mapping is missing for a particular character. For example, if you are mapping Unicode characters to a particular native character set that does not support particular Unicode characters, the mapper will follow the behaviour specified in this property. Valid values are: skip - skip any characters that do not exist in the target charset placeholder - put a static placeholder character in the output string wherever there is an unknown character in the input string.

When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, because the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done.

The comparator function assumes that the strings it is comparing contain Unicode characters encoded in UTF-16. Collations usually depend only on the language, because most collation orders are shared between locales that speak the same language. There are, however, a number of instances where a locale collates differently than other locales that share the same language. There are also a number of instances where a locale collates differently based on the script used. This object can handle these cases automatically if a full locale is specified in the options rather than just a language code. Options The options parameter can contain any of the following properties: locale - String|Locale. The locale which the comparator function will collate with. Default: the current iLib locale. sensitivity - String. Sensitivity or strength of collator. This is one of \"primary\", \"base\", \"secondary\", \"accent\", \"tertiary\", \"case\", \"quaternary\", or \"variant\". Default: \"primary\" base or primary - Only the primary distinctions between characters are significant. Another way of saying that is that the collator will be case-, accent-, and variation-insensitive, and only distinguish between the base characters case or secondary - Both the primary and secondary distinctions between characters are significant. That is, the collator will be accent- and variation-insensitive and will distinguish between base characters and character case. accent or tertiary - The primary, secondary, and tertiary distinctions between characters are all significant. That is, the collator will be variation-insensitive, but accent-, case-, and base-character-sensitive. variant or quaternary - All distinctions between characters are significant. That is, the algorithm is base character-, case-, accent-, and variation-sensitive. upperFirst - boolean. When collating case-sensitively in a script that has the concept of case, put upper-case characters first, otherwise lower-case will come first. Warning: some browsers do not implement this feature or at least do not implement it properly, so if you are using the native collator with this option, you may get different results in different browsers. To guarantee the same results, set useNative to false to use the ilib collator implementation. This of course will be somewhat slower, but more predictable. Default: true reverse - boolean. Return the list sorted in reverse order. When the upperFirst option is also set to true, upper-case characters would then come at the end of the list. Default: false. scriptOrder - string. When collating strings in multiple scripts, this property specifies what order those scripts should be sorted. The default Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) already has a default order for scripts, but this can be tailored via this property. The value of this option is a space-separated list of ISO 15924 scripts codes. If a code is specified in this property, its default data must be included using the JS assembly tool. If the data is not included, the ordering for the script will be ignored. Default: the default order defined by the UCA. style - The value of the style parameter is dependent on the locale. For some locales, there are different styles of collating strings depending on what kind of strings are being collated or what the preference of the user is. For example, in German, there is a phonebook order and a dictionary ordering that sort the same array of strings slightly differently. The static method Collator#getAvailableStyles will return a list of styles that ilib currently knows about for any given locale. If the value of the style option is not recognized for a locale, it will be ignored. Default style is \"standard\". usage - Whether this collator will be used for searching or sorting. Valid values are simply the strings \"sort\" or \"search\". When used for sorting, it is good idea if a collator produces a stable sort. That is, the order of the sorted array of strings should not depend on the order of the strings in the input array. As such, when a collator is supposed to act case insensitively, it nonetheless still distinguishes between case after all other criteria are satisfied so that strings that are distinguished only by case do not sort randomly. For searching, we would like to match two strings that different only by case, so the collator must return equals in that situation instead of further distinguishing by case. Default is \"sort\". numeric - Treat the left and right strings as if they started with numbers and sort them numerically rather than lexically. ignorePunctuation - Skip punctuation characters when comparing the strings. onLoad - a callback function to call when the collator object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the collator object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. useNative - when this option is true, use the native Intl object provided by the Javascript engine, if it exists, to implement this class. If it doesn't exist, or if this parameter is false, then this class uses a pure Javascript implementation, which is slower and uses a lot more memory, but works everywhere that ilib works. Default is \"true\". Operation The Collator constructor returns a collator object tailored with the above options. The object contains an internal compare() method which compares two strings according to those options. This can be used directly to compare two strings, but is not useful for passing to the javascript sort function because then it will not have its collation data available. Instead, use the getComparator() method to retrieve a function that is bound to the collator object. (You could also bind it yourself using ilib.bind()). The bound function can be used with the standard Javascript array sorting algorithm, or as a comparator with your own sorting algorithm. Example using the standard Javascript array sorting call with the bound function: var arr = [\"ö\", \"oe\", \"ü\", \"o\", \"a\", \"ae\", \"u\", \"ß\", \"ä\"]; var collator = new Collator({locale: 'de-DE', style: \"dictionary\"}); arr.sort(collator.getComparator()); console.log(JSON.stringify(arr)); Would give the output: [\"a\", \"ae\", \"ä\", \"o\", \"oe\", \"ö\", \"ß\", \"u\", \"ü\"] When sorting an array of Javascript objects according to one of the string properties of the objects, wrap the collator's compare function in your own comparator function that knows the structure of the objects being sorted: var collator = new Collator({locale: 'de-DE'}); var myComparator = function (collator) { var comparator = collator.getComparator(); // left and right are your own objects return function (left, right) { return comparator(left.x.y.textProperty, right.x.y.textProperty); }; }; arr.sort(myComparator(collator)); Sort Keys The collator class also has a method to retrieve the sort key for a string. The sort key is an array of values that represent how each character in the string should be collated according to the characteristics of the collation algorithm and the given options. Thus, sort keys can be compared directly value-for-value with other sort keys that were generated by the same collator, and the resulting ordering is guaranteed to be the same as if the original strings were compared by the collator. Sort keys generated by different collators are not guaranteed to give any reasonable results when compared together unless the two collators were constructed with exactly the same options and therefore end up representing the exact same collation sequence. A good rule of thumb is that you would use a sort key if you had 10 or more items to sort or if your array might be resorted arbitrarily. For example, if your user interface was displaying a table with 100 rows in it, and each row had 4 sortable text columns which could be sorted in acending or descending order, the recommended practice would be to generate a sort key for each of the 4 sortable fields in each row and store that in the Javascript representation of the table data. Then, when the user clicks on a column header to resort the table according to that column, the resorting would be relatively quick because it would only be comparing arrays of values, and not recalculating the collation values for each character in each string for every comparison. For tables that are large, it is usually a better idea to do the sorting on the server side, especially if the table is the result of a database query. In this case, the table is usually a view of the cursor of a large results set, and only a few entries are sent to the front end at a time. In order to sort the set efficiently, it should be done on the database level instead. Data Doing correct collation entails a huge amount of mapping data, much of which is not necessary when collating in one language with one script, which is the most common case. Thus, ilib implements a number of ways to include the data you need or leave out the data you don't need using the JS assembly tool: Full multilingual data - if you are sorting multilingual data and need to collate text written in multiple scripts, you can use the directive \"!data collation/ducet\" to load in the full collation data. This allows the collator to perform the entire Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) based on the Default Unicode Collation Element Table (DUCET). The data is very large, on the order of multiple megabytes, but sometimes it is necessary. A few scripts - if you are sorting text written in only a few scripts, you may want to include only the data for those scripts. Each ISO 15924 script code has its own data available in a separate file, so you can use the data directive to include only the data for the scripts you need. For example, use \"!data collation/Latn\" to retrieve the collation information for the Latin script. Because the \"ducet\" table mentioned in the previous point is a superset of the tables for all other scripts, you do not need to include explicitly the data for any particular script when using \"ducet\". That is, you either include \"ducet\" or you include a specific list of scripts. Only one script - if you are sorting text written only in one script, you can either include the data directly as in the previous point, or you can rely on the locale to include the correct data for you. In this case, you can use the directive \"!data collate\" to load in the locale's collation data for its most common script. With any of the above ways of including the data, the collator will only perform the correct language-sensitive sorting for the given locale. All other scripts will be sorted in the default manner according to the UCA. For example, if you include the \"ducet\" data and pass in \"de-DE\" (German for Germany) as the locale spec, then only the Latin script (the default script for German) will be sorted according to German rules. All other scripts in the DUCET, such as Japanese or Arabic, will use the default UCA collation rules. If this collator encounters a character for which it has no collation data, it will sort those characters by pure Unicode value after all characters for which it does have collation data. For example, if you only loaded in the German collation data (ie. the data for the Latin script tailored to German) to sort a list of person names, but that list happens to include the names of a few Japanese people written in Japanese characters, the Japanese names will sort at the end of the list after all German names, and will sort according to the Unicode values of the characters. new Collator(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options governing how the resulting comparator function will operate Methods compare(left, right) Compare two strings together according to the rules of this collator instance. Do not use this function directly with Array.sort, as it will not have its collation data available and therefore will not function properly. Use the function returned by getComparator() instead. Parameters: Name Type Description left string the left string to compare right string the right string to compare Returns: a negative number if left comes before right, a positive number if right comes before left, and zero if left and right are equivalent according to this collator Type number getComparator() Return a comparator function that can compare two strings together according to the rules of this collator instance. The function returns a negative number if the left string comes before right, a positive number if the right string comes before the left, and zero if left and right are equivalent. If the reverse property was given as true to the collator constructor, this function will switch the sign of those values to cause sorting to happen in the reverse order. Returns: a comparator function that can compare two strings together according to the rules of this collator instance Type function | undefined getDefaultCollatorStyle() Return a default collation style Returns: default collation style such as 'latin', 'korean' etc Type string sortKey(str) Return a sort key string for the given string. The sort key string is a list of values that represent each character in the original string. The sort key values for any particular character consists of 3 numbers that encode the primary, secondary, and tertiary characteristics of that character. The values of each characteristic are modified according to the strength of this collator instance to give the correct collation order. The idea is that this sort key string is directly comparable byte-for-byte to other sort key strings generated by this collator without any further knowledge of the collation rules for the locale. More formally, if a &lt; b according to the rules of this collation, then it is guaranteed that sortkey(a) &lt; sortkey(b) when compared byte-for-byte. The sort key string can therefore be used without the collator to sort an array of strings efficiently because the work of determining the applicability of various collation rules is done once up-front when generating the sort key. The sort key string can be treated as a regular, albeit somewhat odd-looking, string. That is, it can be pass to regular Javascript functions without problems. Parameters: Name Type Description str string the original string to generate the sort key for Returns: a sort key string for the given string Type string &lt;static&gt; getAvailableScripts() Retrieve the list of ISO 15924 script codes that are available in this copy of ilib. This list varies depending on whether or not the data for various scripts was assembled into this copy of ilib. If the \"ducet\" data is assembled into this copy of ilib, this method will report the entire list of scripts as being available. If a collator instance is instantiated with a script code that is not on the list returned by this function, it will be ignored and text in that script will be sorted by numeric Unicode values of the characters. Returns: Array. an array of ISO 15924 script codes that are available &lt;static&gt; getAvailableStyles(locale) Retrieve the list of collation style names that are available for the given locale. This list varies depending on the locale, and depending on whether or not the data for that locale was assembled into this copy of ilib. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string The locale for which the available styles are being sought Returns: Array. an array of style names that are available for the given locale × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

The constructor can be called with a parameter object that contains any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 (Gregorian). julianday - the Julian Day to set into this date year - any integer month - 1 to 13, where 1 means Thoout, 2 means Paope, etc., and 13 means Epagomene day - 1 to 30 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 locale - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this coptic date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. timezone - the time zone of this instance. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If called with another Coptic date argument, the date components of the given date are copied into the current one. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). new CopticDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Coptic date Extends EthiopicDate Members day :number The day of the month.

The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year.

Overrides: EthiopicDate#getCalendar Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Overrides: EthiopicDate#getDayOfWeek Returns: the day of the week Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number &lt;protected&gt; newRd( [params]) Return a new RD for this date type using the given params. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; the parameters used to create this rata die instance Overrides: EthiopicDate#newRd Returns: the new RD instance for the given params Type RataDie onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date.

Instances of this class encode information about country name. The options can contain any of the following properties: locale - specify the locale for this instance. Country names are provided in the language of this locale. onLoad - a callback function to call when the country name data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If the locale is not set, the default locale(en-US) will be used. new Country(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object a set of properties to govern how this instance is constructed. Methods getCode(ctryname) Return the country code corresponding to the country name given. If the country name is given, but it is not found in the list of known countries, this method will throw an exception. Parameters: Name Type Description ctryname string The country name in the language of the locale of this instance Throws: \"Country xx is unknown\" when the given country name is not in the list of known country names. xx is replaced with the requested country name. Returns: the country code corresponding to the country name Type string getLocale() Return the locale for this country. If the options to the constructor included a locale property in order to find the country that is appropriate for that locale, then the locale is returned here. If the options did not include a locale, then this method returns undefined. Returns: the locale used in the constructor of this instance, or undefined if no locale was given in the constructor Type Locale getName(code) Return the country name corresponding to the country code given. If the code is given, but it is not found in the list of known countries, this method will throw an exception. Parameters: Name Type Description code string The country code to get the country name Throws: \"Country xx is unknown\" when the given country code is not in the list of known country codes. xx is replaced with the requested country code. Returns: the country name in the language of the locale of this instance Type string &lt;static&gt; getAvailableCode() Return an array of the ids for all ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code that this copy of ilib knows about.

Instances of this class encode information about a particular currency. Note: that if you are looking to format currency for display, please see the number formatting class {NumFmt}. This class only gives information about currencies. The options can contain any of the following properties: locale - specify the locale for this instance code - find info on a specific currency with the given ISO 4217 code sign - search for a currency that uses this sign onLoad - a callback function to call when the currency data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. When searching for a currency by its sign, this class cannot guarantee that it will return info about a specific currency. The reason is that currency signs are sometimes shared between different currencies and the sign is therefore ambiguous. If you need a guarantee, find the currency using the code instead. The way this class finds a currency by sign is the following. If the sign is unambiguous, then the currency is returned. If there are multiple currencies that use the same sign, and the current locale uses that sign, then the default currency for the current locale is returned. If there are multiple, but the current locale does not use that sign, then the currency with the largest circulation is returned. For example, if you are in the en-GB locale, and the sign is \"$\", then this class will notice that there are multiple currencies with that sign (USD, CAD, AUD, HKD, MXP, etc.) Since \"$\" is not used in en-GB, it will pick the one with the largest circulation, which in this case is the US Dollar (USD). If neither the code or sign property is set, the currency that is most common for the locale will be used instead. If the locale is not set, the default locale will be used. If the code is given, but it is not found in the list of known currencies, this constructor will throw an exception. If the sign is given, but it is not found, this constructor will default to the currency for the current locale. If both the code and sign properties are given, then the sign property will be ignored and only the code property used. If the locale is given, but it is not a known locale, this class will default to the default locale instead. new Currency(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object a set of properties to govern how this instance is constructed. Throws: \"currency xxx is unknown\" when the given currency code is not in the list of known currencies. xxx is replaced with the requested code. Methods getCode() Return the ISO 4217 currency code for this instance. Returns: the ISO 4217 currency code for this instance Type string getFractionDigits() Return the default number of fraction digits that is typically used with this type of currency. Returns: the number of fraction digits for this currency Type number getLocale() Return the locale for this currency. If the options to the constructor included a locale property in order to find the currency that is appropriate for that locale, then the locale is returned here. If the options did not include a locale, then this method returns undefined. Returns: the locale used in the constructor of this instance, or undefined if no locale was given in the constructor Type Locale getName() Return the name of the currency in English. Returns: the name of the currency in English Type string getSign() Return the sign commonly used to represent this currency. Returns: the sign commonly used to represent this currency Type string &lt;static&gt; getAvailableCurrencies() Return an array of the ids for all ISO 4217 currencies that this copy of ilib knows about.

The date formatter is immutable once it is created, but can format as many different dates as needed with the same options. Create different date formatter instances for different purposes and then keep them cached for use later if you have more than one date to format. The options may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale to use when formatting the date/time. If the locale is not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used. calendar - the type of calendar to use for this format. The value should be a sting containing the name of the calendar. Currently, the supported types are \"gregorian\", \"julian\", \"arabic\", \"hebrew\", or \"chinese\". If the calendar is not specified, then the default calendar for the locale is used. When the calendar type is specified, then the format method must be called with an instance of the appropriate date type. (eg. Gregorian calendar means that the format method must be called with a GregDate instance.) timezone - time zone to use when formatting times. This may be a time zone instance or a time zone specifier from the IANA list of time zone database names (eg. \"America/Los_Angeles\"), the string \"local\", or a string specifying the offset in RFC 822 format. The IANA list of time zone names can be viewed at this page. If the time zone is given as \"local\", the offset from UTC as given by the Javascript system is used. If the offset is given as an RFC 822 style offset specifier, it will parse that string and use the resulting offset. If the time zone is not specified, the default time zone for the locale is used. If both the date object and this formatter instance contain time zones and those time zones are different from each other, the formatter will calculate the offset between the time zones and subtract it from the date before formatting the result for the current time zone. The theory is that a date object that contains a time zone specifies a specific instant in time that is valid around the world, whereas a date object without one is a local time and can only be used for doing things in the local time zone of the user. type - Specify whether this formatter should format times only, dates only, or both times and dates together. Valid values are \"time\", \"date\", and \"datetime\". Note that in some locales, the standard format uses the order \"time followed by date\" and in others, the order is exactly opposite, so it is better to create a single \"datetime\" formatter than it is to create a time formatter and a date formatter separately and concatenate the results. A \"datetime\" formatter will get the order correct for the locale. The default type if none is specified in with the type option is \"date\". length - Specify the length of the format to use. The length is the approximate size of the formatted string. short - use a short representation of the time. This is the most compact format possible for the locale. medium - use a medium length representation of the time. This is a slightly longer format. long - use a long representation of the time. This is a fully specified format, but some of the textual components may still be abbreviated full - use a full representation of the time. This is a fully specified format where all the textual components are spelled out completely eg. The \"short\" format for an en_US date may be \"MM/dd/yy\", whereas the long format might be \"d MMM, yyyy\". In the long format, the month name is textual instead of numeric and is longer, the year is 4 digits instead of 2, and the format contains slightly more spaces and formatting characters. Note that the length parameter does not specify which components are to be formatted. Use the \"date\" and the \"time\" properties to specify the components. Also, very few of the components of a time format differ according to the length, so this property has little to no affect on time formatting. date - This property tells which components of a date format to use. For example, sometimes you may wish to format a date that only contains the month and date without the year, such as when displaying a person's yearly birthday. The value of this property allows you to specify only those components you want to see in the final output, ordered correctly for the locale. Valid values are: dmwy - format all components, weekday, date, month, and year dmy - format only date, month, and year dmw - format only weekday, date, and month dm - format only date and month my - format only month and year dw - format only the weekday and date d - format only the date m - format only the month, in numbers for shorter lengths, and letters for longer lengths n - format only the month, in letters only for all lengths y - format only the year Default components, if this property is not specified, is \"dmy\". This property may be specified but has no affect if the current formatter is for times only. As of ilib 12.0, you can now pass ICU style skeletons in this option similar to the ones you get from DateTimePatternGenerator.getSkeleton(). It will not extract the length from the skeleton so you still need to pass the length property, but it will extract the date components. time - This property gives which components of a time format to use. The time will be formatted correctly for the locale with only the time components requested. For example, a clock might only display the hour and minute and not need the seconds or the am/pm component. In this case, the time property should be set to \"hm\". Valid values for this property are: ahmsz - format the hours, minutes, seconds, am/pm (if using a 12 hour clock), and the time zone ahms - format the hours, minutes, seconds, and am/pm (if using a 12 hour clock) hmsz - format the hours, minutes, seconds, and the time zone hms - format the hours, minutes, and seconds ahmz - format the hours, minutes, am/pm (if using a 12 hour clock), and the time zone ahm - format the hours, minutes, and am/pm (if using a 12 hour clock) hmz - format the hours, minutes, and the time zone ah - format only the hours and am/pm if using a 12 hour clock hm - format only the hours and minutes ms - format only the minutes and seconds h - format only the hours m - format only the minutes s - format only the seconds If you want to format a length of time instead of a particular instant in time, use the duration formatter object (DurationFmt) instead because this formatter is geared towards instants. A date formatter will make sure that each component of the time is within the normal range for that component. That is, the minutes will always be between 0 and 59, no matter what is specified in the date to format. A duration format will allow the number of minutes to exceed 59 if, for example, you were displaying the length of a movie of 198 minutes. Default value if this property is not specified is \"hma\". As of ilib 12.0, you can now pass ICU style skeletons in this option similar to the ones you get from DateTimePatternGenerator.getSkeleton(). It will not extract the length from the skeleton so you still need to pass the length property, but it will extract the time components. clock - specify that the time formatter should use a 12 or 24 hour clock. Valid values are \"12\" and \"24\". In some locales, both clocks are used. For example, in en_US, the general populace uses a 12 hour clock with am/pm, but in the US military or in nautical or aeronautical or scientific writing, it is more common to use a 24 hour clock. This property allows you to construct a formatter that overrides the default for the locale. If this property is not specified, the default is to use the most widely used convention for the locale. template - use the given template string as a fixed format when formatting the date/time. Valid codes to use in a template string are as follows: a - am/pm marker B - the current day period d - 1 or 2 digit date of month, not padded dd - 1 or 2 digit date of month, 0 padded to 2 digits O - ordinal representation of the date of month (eg. \"1st\", \"2nd\", etc.) D - 1 to 3 digit day of year DD - 1 to 3 digit day of year, 0 padded to 2 digits DDD - 1 to 3 digit day of year, 0 padded to 3 digits M - 1 or 2 digit month number, not padded MM - 1 or 2 digit month number, 0 padded to 2 digits N - 1 character month name abbreviation NN - 2 character month name abbreviation MMM - 3 character month name abbreviation MMMM - fully spelled out month name L - 1 character stand-alone month name abbreviation LL - 2 character stand-alone month name abbreviation LLL - 3 character stand-alone month name abbreviation LLLL - fully spelled out stand-alone month name yy - 2 digit year yyyy - 4 digit year E - day-of-week name, abbreviated to a single character EE - day-of-week name, abbreviated to a max of 2 characters EEE - day-of-week name, abbreviated to a max of 3 characters EEEE - day-of-week name fully spelled out c - stand-alone day-of-week name, abbreviated to a single character cc - stand-alone day-of-week name, abbreviated to a max of 2 characters ccc - stand-alone day-of-week name, abbreviated to a max of 3 characters cccc - stand-alone day-of-week name fully spelled out G - era designator w - week number in year ww - week number in year, 0 padded to 2 digits W - week in month h - hour (12 followed by 1 to 11) hh - hour (12, followed by 1 to 11), 0 padded to 2 digits k - hour (1 to 24) kk - hour (1 to 24), 0 padded to 2 digits H - hour (0 to 23) HH - hour (0 to 23), 0 padded to 2 digits K - hour (0 to 11) KK - hour (0 to 11), 0 padded to 2 digits m - minute in hour mm - minute in hour, 0 padded to 2 digits s - second in minute ss - second in minute, 0 padded to 2 digits S - millisecond (1 to 3 digits) SSS - millisecond, 0 padded to 3 digits z - general time zone Z - RFC 822 time zone useNative - the flag used to determine whether to use the native script settings for formatting the numbers. meridiems - string that specifies what style of meridiems to use with this format. The choices are \"default\", \"gregorian\", \"ethiopic\", and \"chinese\". The \"default\" style is often the simple Gregorian AM/PM, but the actual style is chosen by the locale. (For almost all locales, the Gregorian AM/PM style is most frequently used.) The \"ethiopic\" style uses 5 different meridiems for \"morning\", \"noon\", \"afternoon\", \"evening\", and \"night\". The \"chinese\" style uses 7 different meridiems corresponding to the various parts of the day. N.B. Even for the Chinese locales, the default is \"gregorian\" when formatting dates in the Gregorian calendar. useIntl - choose whether Intl.DateTimeFormat object for formatting. When it is set to true, the Intl object is available, it supports the requested locale, and the parameters can be converted to equivalent parameters for the Intl.DateTimeFormat object, then it will format the date relatively quickly using Intl. When they cannot be converted, the Intl object is not available, or the Intl object does not support the requested locale, it will perform the relatively slow formatting using regular ilib code written in Javascript. The code will often return different results depending on the platform and version of the Javascript engine and which version of CLDR it supports. If you need consistency across versions and platforms, do not use the useIntl flag. Just stick with the regular ilib formatting code. onLoad - a callback function to call when the date format object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the DateFmt object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Any substring containing letters within single or double quotes will be used as-is in the final output and will not be interpretted for codes as above. Example: a date format in Spanish might be given as: \"'El' d. 'de' MMMM\", where the 'El' and the 'de' are left as-is in the output because they are quoted. Typical output for this example template might be, \"El 5. de Mayo\". The following options will be used when formatting a date/time with an explicit template: locale - the locale is only used for translations of things like month names or day-of-week names. calendar - used to translate a date instance into date/time component values that can be formatted into the template timezone - used to figure out the offset to add or subtract from the time to get the final time component values clock - used to figure out whether to format times with a 12 or 24 hour clock. If this option is specified, it will override the hours portion of a time format. That is, \"hh\" is switched with \"HH\" and \"kk\" is switched with \"KK\" as appropriate. If this option is not specified, the 12/24 code in the template will dictate whether to use the 12 or 24 clock, and the 12/24 default in the locale will be ignored. All other options will be ignored and their corresponding getter methods will return the empty string. new DateFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options governing the way this date formatter instance works Methods &lt;protected&gt; _getFormat(obj, components, length) Parameters: Name Type Description obj Object.&lt;string, (string|{s:string, m:string, l:string, f:string})&gt; Object to search components string Format components to search length string Length of the requested format Returns: the requested format Type string | undefined &lt;protected&gt; _getFormatInternal(obj, components, length) Parameters: Name Type Description obj Object.&lt;string, (string|{s:string, m:string, l:string, f:string})&gt; Object to search components string Format components to search length string Length of the requested format Returns: the requested format Type string | undefined &lt;protected&gt; _getLengthFormat(obj, length) Parameters: Name Type Description obj string | Object Object to search length string Length of the requested format Returns: the requested format Type string | undefined &lt;protected&gt; _initTemplate(formats) Parameters: Name Type Description formats string | Object &lt;protected&gt; _massageTemplate() &lt;protected&gt; _tokenize(template) Convert the template into an array of date components separated by formatting chars. Parameters: Name Type Description template string Format template to tokenize into components Returns: a tokenized array of date format components Type Array.&lt;string&gt; format(dateLike) Format a particular date instance according to the settings of this formatter object. The type of the date instance being formatted must correspond exactly to the calendar type with which this formatter was constructed. If the types are not compatible, this formatter will produce bogus results. Parameters: Name Type Description dateLike IDate | number | string | Date | JulianDay | null | undefined a date-like object to format Returns: the formatted version of the given date instance Type string formatRelative(reference, date) Return a string that describes a date relative to the given reference date. The string returned is text that for the locale that was specified when the formatter instance was constructed. The date can be in the future relative to the reference date or in the past, and the formatter will generate the appropriate string. The text used to describe the relative reference depends on the length of time between the date and the reference. If the time was in the past, it will use the \"ago\" phrase, and in the future, it will use the \"in\" phrase. Examples: within a minute: either \"X seconds ago\" or \"in X seconds\" within an hour: either \"X minutes ago\" or \"in X minutes\" within a day: either \"X hours ago\" or \"in X hours\" within 2 weeks: either \"X days ago\" or \"in X days\" within 12 weeks (~3 months): either \"X weeks ago\" or \"in X weeks\" within two years: either \"X months ago\" or \"in X months\" longer than 2 years: \"X years ago\" or \"in X years\" Parameters: Name Type Description reference IDate | number | string | Date | JulianDay | null | undefined a date that the date parameter should be relative to date IDate | number | string | Date | JulianDay | null | undefined a date being formatted Throws: \"Wrong calendar type\" when the start or end dates are not the same calendar type as the formatter itself Returns: the formatted relative date Type string getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar used to format date/times for this formatter instance. Returns: the name of the calendar used by this formatter Type string getClock() Return the clock option set in the constructor. If the clock option was not given, the default from the locale is returned instead. Returns: \"12\" or \"24\" depending on whether this formatter uses the 12-hour or 24-hour clock Type string getDateComponentOrder() Return the order of the year, month, and date components for the current locale. When implementing a date input widget in a UI, it would be useful to know what order to put the year, month, and date input fields so that it conforms to the user expectations for the locale. This method gives that order by returning a string that has a single \"y\", \"m\", and \"d\" character in it in the correct order. For example, the return value \"ymd\" means that this locale formats the year first, the month second, and the date third, and \"mdy\" means that the month is first, the date is second, and the year is third. Four of the 6 possible permutations of the three letters have at least one locale that uses that ordering, though some combinations are far more likely than others. The ones that are not used by any locales are \"dym\" and \"myd\", though new locales are still being added to CLDR frequently, and possible orderings cannot be predicted. Your code should support all 6 possibilities, just in case. Returns: a string giving the date component order Type string getDateComponents() Return the date components that this formatter formats. This is either the value of the date option to the constructor, or the default value. If this formatter is a time-only formatter, this method will return the empty string. The date component letters may be specified in any order in the constructor, but this method will reorder the given components to a standard order. Returns: the date components that this formatter formats Type string getDaysOfWeek( [options]) Returns an array of the days of the week, formatted to the optional length specified. i.e. ...getDaysOfWeek() OR ...getDaysOfWeek({length: \"short\"}) The options parameter may contain any of the following properties: length - length of the names of the months being sought. This may be one of \"short\", \"medium\", \"long\", or \"full\" Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; an object-literal that contains one key \"length\" with the standard length strings Returns: an array of all of the names of the days of the week Type Array getLength() Return the length used to format date/times in this formatter. This is either the value of the length option to the constructor, or the default value. Returns: the length of formats this formatter returns Type string getLocale() Return the locale used with this formatter instance. Returns: the Locale instance for this formatter Type Locale getMeridiemsRange() Return the meridiems range in current locale. Returns: the range of available meridiems Type Array.&lt;{name:string, start:string, end:string}&gt; getMonthsOfYear( [options]) Returns an array of the months of the year, formatted to the optional length specified. i.e. ...getMonthsOfYear() OR ...getMonthsOfYear({length: \"short\"}) The options parameter may contain any of the following properties: length - length of the names of the months being sought. This may be one of \"short\", \"medium\", \"long\", or \"full\" date - retrieve the names of the months in the date of the given date year - retrieve the names of the months in the given year. In some calendars, the months have different names depending if that year is a leap year or not. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; an object-literal that contains any of the above properties Returns: an array of the names of all of the months of the year in the current calendar Type Array getTemplate() Return the template string that is used to format date/times for this formatter instance. This will work, even when the template property is not explicitly given in the options to the constructor. Without the template option, the constructor will build the appropriate template according to the options and use that template in the format method. Returns: the format template for this formatter Type string getTimeComponents() Return the time components that this formatter formats. This is either the value of the time option to the constructor, or the default value. If this formatter is a date-only formatter, this method will return the empty string. The time component letters may be specified in any order in the constructor, but this method will reorder the given components to a standard order. Returns: the time components that this formatter formats Type string getTimeZone() Return the time zone used to format date/times for this formatter instance. Returns: a time zone object that this formatter is formatting for Type TimeZone getType() Return the type of this formatter. The type is a string that has one of the following values: \"time\", \"date\", \"datetime\". Returns: the type of the formatter Type string toString() Convert this formatter to a string representation by returning the format template. This method delegates to getTemplate. Returns: the format template Type string &lt;static&gt; getMeridiemsRange(options) Return the range of possible meridiems (times of day like \"AM\" or \"PM\") in this date formatter. The options may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale to use when formatting the date/time. If the locale is not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used. meridiems - string that specifies what style of meridiems to use with this format. The choices are \"default\", \"gregorian\", \"ethiopic\", and \"chinese\". The \"default\" style is often the simple Gregorian AM/PM, but the actual style is chosen by the locale. (For almost all locales, the Gregorian AM/PM style is most frequently used.) The \"ethiopic\" style uses 5 different meridiems for \"morning\", \"noon\", \"afternoon\", \"evening\", and \"night\". The \"chinese\" style uses 7 different meridiems corresponding to the various parts of the day. N.B. Even for the Chinese locales, the default is \"gregorian\" when formatting dates in the Gregorian calendar. Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options governing the way this date formatter instance works for getting meridiems range Returns: Type Array.&lt;{name:string, start:string, end:string}&gt; &lt;static&gt; isIntlDateTimeAvailable(locale) return true if the locale is supported in date and time formatting for Intl.DateTimeFormat Object locale - locale to check if it is available or not. If the locale is not specified, then it returns false. Parameters: Name Type Description locale string locale to check if it is available or not.

The date range formatter is immutable once it is created, but can format as many different date ranges as needed with the same options. Create different date range formatter instances for different purposes and then keep them cached for use later if you have more than one range to format. The options may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale to use when formatting the date/times in the range. If the locale is not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used. calendar - the type of calendar to use for this format. The value should be a sting containing the name of the calendar. Currently, the supported types are \"gregorian\", \"julian\", \"arabic\", \"hebrew\", or \"chinese\". If the calendar is not specified, then the default calendar for the locale is used. When the calendar type is specified, then the format method must be called with an instance of the appropriate date type. (eg. Gregorian calendar means that the format method must be called with a GregDate instance.) timezone - time zone to use when formatting times. This may be a time zone instance or a time zone specifier string in RFC 822 format. If not specified, the default time zone for the locale is used. length - Specify the length of the format to use as a string. The length is the approximate size of the formatted string. short - use a short representation of the time. This is the most compact format possible for the locale. medium - use a medium length representation of the time. This is a slightly longer format. long - use a long representation of the time. This is a fully specified format, but some of the textual components may still be abbreviated. (eg. \"Tue\" instead of \"Tuesday\") full - use a full representation of the time. This is a fully specified format where all the textual components are spelled out completely. eg. The \"short\" format for an en_US range may be \"MM/yy - MM/yy\", whereas the long format might be \"MMM, yyyy - MMM, yyyy\". In the long format, the month name is textual instead of numeric and is longer, the year is 4 digits instead of 2, and the format contains slightly more spaces and formatting characters. Note that the length parameter does not specify which components are to be formatted. The components that are formatted depend on the length of time in the range. clock - specify that formatted times should use a 12 or 24 hour clock if the format happens to include times. Valid values are \"12\" and \"24\". In some locales, both clocks are used. For example, in en_US, the general populace uses a 12 hour clock with am/pm, but in the US military or in nautical or aeronautical or scientific writing, it is more common to use a 24 hour clock. This property allows you to construct a formatter that overrides the default for the locale. If this property is not specified, the default is to use the most widely used convention for the locale. onLoad - a callback function to call when the date range format object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the DateRngFmt object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new DateRngFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options governing the way this date range formatter instance works Methods format(startDateLike, endDateLike) Format a date/time range according to the settings of the current formatter. The range is specified as being from the \"start\" date until the \"end\" date. The template that the date/time range uses depends on the length of time between the dates, on the premise that a long date range which is too specific is not useful. For example, when giving the dates of the 100 Years War, in most situations it would be more appropriate to format the range as \"1337 - 1453\" than to format it as \"10:37am November 9, 1337 - 4:37pm July 17, 1453\", as the latter format is much too specific given the length of time that the range represents. If a very specific, but long, date range really is needed, the caller should format two specific dates separately and put them together as you might with other normal strings. The format used for a date range contains the following date components, where the order of those components is rearranged and the component values are translated according to each locale: within 3 days: the times of day, dates, months, and years within 730 days (2 years): the dates, months, and years within 3650 days (10 years): the months and years longer than 10 years: the years only In general, if any of the date components share a value between the start and end date, that component is only given once. For example, if the range is from November 15, 2011 to November 26, 2011, the start and end dates both share the same month and year. The range would then be formatted as \"November 15-26, 2011\". If you want to format a length of time instead of a particular range of time (for example, the length of an event rather than the specific start time and end time of that event), then use a duration formatter instance (DurationFmt) instead. The formatRange method will make sure that each component of the date/time is within the normal range for that component. For example, the minutes will always be between 0 and 59, no matter what is specified in the date to format, because that is the normal range for minutes. A duration format will allow the number of minutes to exceed 59. For example, if you were displaying the length of a movie that is 198 minutes long, the minutes component of a duration could be 198. Parameters: Name Type Description startDateLike IDate | Date | number | string the starting date/time of the range. The date may be given as an ilib IDate object, a javascript intrinsic Date object, a unix time, or a date string parsable by the javscript Date. endDateLike IDate | Date | number | string the ending date/time of the range. The date may be given as an ilib IDate object, a javascript intrinsic Date object, a unix time, or a date string parsable by the javscript Date. Throws: \"Wrong calendar type\" when the start or end dates are not the same calendar type as the formatter itself Returns: a date range formatted for the locale Type string getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar used to format date/times for this formatter instance. Returns: the name of the calendar used by this formatter Type string getClock() Return the clock option set in the constructor. If the clock option was not given, the default from the locale is returned instead. Returns: \"12\" or \"24\" depending on whether this formatter uses the 12-hour or 24-hour clock Type string getLength() Return the length used to format date/times in this formatter. This is either the value of the length option to the constructor, or the default value. Returns: the length of formats this formatter returns Type string getLocale() Return the locale used with this formatter instance. Returns: the Locale instance for this formatter Type Locale getTimeZone() Return the time zone used to format date/times for this formatter instance. Returns: a string naming the time zone Type TimeZone × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way.

Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers.

Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\".

Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero.

The duration formatter is immutable once it is created, but can format as many different durations as needed with the same options. Create different duration formatter instances for different purposes and then keep them cached for use later if you have more than one duration to format. Duration formatters format lengths of time. The duration formatter is meant to format durations of such things as the length of a song or a movie or a meeting, or the current position in that song or movie while playing it. If you wish to format a period of time that has a specific start and end date/time, then use a [DateRngFmt] instance instead and call its format method. The options may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale to use when formatting the duration. If the locale is not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used. length - Specify the length of the format to use. The length is the approximate size of the formatted string. short - use a short representation of the duration. This is the most compact format possible for the locale. eg. 1y 1m 1w 1d 1:01:01 medium - use a medium length representation of the duration. This is a slightly longer format. eg. 1 yr 1 mo 1 wk 1 dy 1 hr 1 mi 1 se long - use a long representation of the duration. This is a fully specified format, but some of the textual parts may still be abbreviated. eg. 1 yr 1 mo 1 wk 1 day 1 hr 1 min 1 sec full - use a full representation of the duration. This is a fully specified format where all the textual parts are spelled out completely. eg. 1 year, 1 month, 1 week, 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute and 1 second style - whether hours, minutes, and seconds should be formatted as a text string or as a regular time as on a clock. eg. text is \"1 hour, 15 minutes\", whereas clock is \"1:15:00\". Valid values for this property are \"text\" or \"clock\". Default if this property is not specified is \"text\". useNative - the flag used to determaine whether to use the native script settings for formatting the numbers . onLoad - a callback function to call when the format data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new DurationFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;nullable&gt; options governing the way this date formatter instance works Methods format(components) Format a duration according to the format template of this formatter instance. The components parameter should be an object that contains any or all of these numeric properties: year month week day hour minute second When a property is left out of the components parameter or has a value of 0, it will not be formatted into the output string, except for times that include 0 minutes and 0 seconds. This formatter will not ensure that numbers for each component property is within the valid range for that component. This allows you to format durations that are longer than normal range. For example, you could format a duration has being \"33 hours\" rather than \"1 day, 9 hours\". Parameters: Name Type Description components Object date/time components to be formatted into a duration string Returns: a string with the duration formatted according to the style and locale set up for this formatter instance. If the components parameter is empty or undefined, an empty string is returned. Type IString getLength() Return the length that was used to construct this duration formatter object. If the length was not given as parameter to the constructor, this method returns the default length. Valid values are \"short\", \"medium\", \"long\", and \"full\".

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way.

Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers.

The constructor can be called with a parameter object that contains any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 (Gregorian). julianday - the Julian Day to set into this date year - any integer month - 1 to 13, where 1 means Maskaram, 2 means Teqemt, etc., and 13 means Paguemen day - 1 to 30 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 locale - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this ethiopic date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. timezone - the time zone of this instance. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If called with another Ethiopic date argument, the date components of the given date are copied into the current one. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). new EthiopicDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Ethiopic date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 30. Type: number dayOfYear :number The day of the year. Ranges from 1 to 366. Type: number hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999. Type: number minute :number The minute of the hours. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number month :number The month number, ranging from 1 (Maskaram) to 13 (Paguemen).

The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number.

Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date.

Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description to string The name of the units to convert to Overrides: Measurement#convert Returns: the converted measurement or undefined if the requested units are for a different measurement type Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling. If this is not defined, this measurement type will use the set of units that it knows about for the given measurement system Overrides: Measurement#expand Returns: an array of new measurements in order from the current units to the smallest units in the system which together are the same measurement as this one Type Array.&lt;Measurement&gt; getAmount() Return the numeric amount of this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling. If this is not defined, this measurement type will use the set of units that it knows about for the given measurement system Overrides: Measurement#scale Returns: a new instance that is scaled to the right level Type Measurement &lt;static&gt; convert(to, from, fuelConsumption) Convert a FuelConsumption to another measure. Parameters: Name Type Description to string unit to convert to from string unit to convert from fuelConsumption number amount to be convert Returns: the converted amount Type number | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This string inherits from the IString class, and adds methods that allow you to access whole glyphs at a time. In Unicode, various accented characters can be created by using a base character and one or more combining characters following it. These appear on the screen to the user as a single glyph. For example, the Latin character \"a\" (U+0061) followed by the combining diaresis character \"¨\" (U+0308) combine together to form the \"a with diaresis\" glyph \"ä\", which looks like a single character on the screen. The big problem with combining characters for web developers is that many CSS engines do not ellipsize text between glyphs. They only deal with single Unicode characters. So if a particular space only allows for 4 characters, the CSS engine will truncate a string at 4 Unicode characters and then add the ellipsis (...) character. What if the fourth Unicode character is the \"a\" and the fifth one is the diaresis? Then a string like \"xxxäxxx\" that is ellipsized at 4 characters will appear as \"xxxa...\" on the screen instead of \"xxxä...\". In the Latin script as it is commonly used, it is not so common to form accented characters using combining accents, so the above example is mostly for illustrative purposes. It is not unheard of however. The situation is much, much worse in scripts such as Thai and Devanagari that normally make very heavy use of combining characters. These scripts do so because Unicode does not include pre-composed versions of the accented characters like it does for Latin, so combining accents are the only way to create these accented and combined versions of the characters. The solution to this problem is not to use the the CSS property \"text-overflow: ellipsis\" in your web site, ever. Instead, use a glyph string to truncate text between glyphs dynamically, rather than truncating between Unicode characters using CSS. Glyph strings are also useful for truncation, hyphenation, and line wrapping, as all of these should be done between glyphs instead of between characters. The options parameter is optional, and may contain any combination of the following properties: onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale data are fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new GlyphString(str [, options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description str string | IString initialize this instance with this string options Object &lt;optional&gt; options governing the way this instance works Extends IString Methods &lt;protected&gt; _toCodePoint(index) Convert the character or the surrogate pair at the given index into the string to a Unicode UCS-4 code point. Parameters: Name Type Description index number index into the string Inherited From: IString#_toCodePoint Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number charAt(index) Same as String.charAt() Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Inherited From: IString#charAt Returns: the character at the given index Type IString charCodeAt(index) Same as String.charCodeAt(). This only reports on 2-byte UCS-2 Unicode values, and does not take into account supplementary characters encoded in UTF-16. If you would like to take account of those characters, use codePointAt() instead. Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Inherited From: IString#charCodeAt Returns: the character code of the character at the given index in the string Type number charIterator() Return an iterator that will step through all of the characters in the string one at a time, taking care to step through decomposed characters and through surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding as single characters. The GlyphString class will return decomposed Unicode characters as a single unit that a user might see on the screen as a single glyph. If the next character in the iteration is a base character and it is followed by combining characters, the base and all its following combining characters are returned as a single unit. The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return that surrogate character rather than the surrogate pair which represents a character in the supplementary planes. The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which returns true if the iterator has more characters to iterate through, and next() which returns the next character. Inherited From: GlyphString#charIterator Overrides: IString#charIterator Returns: an iterator that iterates through all the characters in the string Type Object codePointAt(index) Return the code point at the given index when the string is viewed as an array of code points. If the index is beyond the end of the array of code points or if the index is negative, -1 is returned. Parameters: Name Type Description index number index of the code point Inherited From: IString#codePointAt Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number codePointLength() Return the number of code points in this string. This may be different than the number of characters, as the UTF-16 encoding that Javascript uses for its basis returns surrogate pairs separately. Two 2-byte surrogate characters together make up one character/code point in the supplementary character planes. If your string contains no characters in the supplementary planes, this method will return the same thing as the length() method. Inherited From: IString#codePointLength Returns: the number of code points in this string Type number concat(strings) Same as String.concat() Parameters: Name Type Description strings string strings to concatenate to the current one Inherited From: IString#concat Returns: a concatenation of the given strings Type IString ellipsize(length) Truncate the current string at the given number of glyphs and add an ellipsis to indicate that is more to the string. The ellipsis forms the last character in the string, so the string is actually truncated at length-1 glyphs. Parameters: Name Type Description length number the number of whole glyphs to keep in the string including the ellipsis Returns: a string truncated to the requested number of glyphs with an ellipsis Type string endsWith() Same as String.endsWith(). Inherited From: IString#endsWith Returns: true if the given characters are found at the end of the string, and false otherwise Type boolean forEach(callback) Call the callback with each character in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only returns a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the surrogate character rather than the the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full character, making sure to join two surrogates into one character in the supplementary planes where necessary. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each full character in the current string Inherited From: IString#forEach forEachCodePoint(callback) Call the callback with each numeric code point in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charCodeAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full code point of each character, making sure to join two surrogates into one code point in the supplementary planes. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each code point in the current string Inherited From: IString#forEachCodePoint format(params) Format this string instance as a message, replacing the parameters with the given values. The string can contain any text that a regular Javascript string can contain. Replacement parameters have the syntax: {name} Where \"name\" can be any string surrounded by curly brackets. The value of \"name\" is taken from the parameters argument. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects. If a property is missing from the parameter block, the replacement parameter substring is left untouched in the string, and a different set of parameters may be applied a second time. This way, different parts of the code may format different parts of the message that they happen to know about. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects in the {container}.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects in the {container}. The result can then be formatted again with a different parameter block that specifies a value for the container property. Parameters: Name Type Description params a Javascript object containing values for the replacement parameters in the current string Inherited From: IString#format Returns: a new IString instance with as many replacement parameters filled out as possible with real values. formatChoice(argIndex, params) Format a string as one of a choice of strings dependent on the value of a particular argument index or array of indices. The syntax of the choice string is as follows. The string contains a series of choices separated by a vertical bar character \"|\". Each choice has a value or range of values to match followed by a hash character \"#\" followed by the string to use if the variable matches the criteria. Example string: var num = 2; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|2#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 2 objects.\" The strings to format may contain replacement variables that will be formatted using the format() method above and the params argument as a source of values to use while formatting those variables. If the criterion for a particular choice is empty, that choice will be used as the default one for use when none of the other choice's criteria match. Example string: var num = 22; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 22 objects.\" If multiple choice patterns can match a given argument index, the first one encountered in the string will be used. If no choice patterns match the argument index, then the default choice will be used. If there is no default choice defined, then this method will return an empty string. Special Syntax For any choice format string, all of the patterns in the string should be of a single type: numeric, boolean, or string/regexp. The type of the patterns is determined by the type of the argument index parameter. If the argument index is numeric, then some special syntax can be used in the patterns to match numeric ranges. &gt;x - match any number that is greater than x &gt;=x - match any number that is greater than or equal to x &lt;x - match any number that is less than x &lt;=x - match any number that is less than or equal to x start-end - match any number in the range [start,end) zero - match any number in the class \"zero\". (See below for a description of number classes.) one - match any number in the class \"one\" two - match any number in the class \"two\" few - match any number in the class \"few\" many - match any number in the class \"many\" other - match any number in the other or default class A number class defines a set of numbers that receive a particular syntax in the strings. For example, in Slovenian, integers ending in the digit \"1\" are in the \"one\" class, including 1, 21, 31, ... 101, 111, etc. Similarly, integers ending in the digit \"2\" are in the \"two\" class. Integers ending in the digits \"3\" or \"4\" are in the \"few\" class, and every other integer is handled by the default string. The definition of what numbers are included in a class is locale-dependent. They are defined in the data file plurals.json. If your string is in a different locale than the default for ilib, you should call the setLocale() method of the string instance before calling this method. Other Pattern Types If the argument index is a boolean, the string values \"true\" and \"false\" may appear as the choice patterns. If the argument index is of type string, then the choice patterns may contain regular expressions, or static strings as degenerate regexps. Multiple Indexes If you have 2 or more indexes to format into a string, you can pass them as an array. When you do that, the patterns to match should be a comma-separate list of patterns as per the rules above. Example string: var str = new IString(\"zero,zero#There are no objects on zero pages.|one,one#There is 1 object on 1 page.|other,one#There are {number} objects on 1 page.|#There are {number} objects on {pages} pages.\"); var num = 4, pages = 1; console.log(str.formatChoice([num, pages], { number: num, pages: pages })); Gives the output: \"There are 4 objects on 1 page.\" Note that when there is a single index, you would typically leave the pattern blank to indicate the default choice. When there are multiple indices, sometimes one of the patterns has to be the default case when the other is not. Rather than leaving one or more of the patterns blank with commas that look out-of-place in the middle of it, you can use the word \"other\" to indicate a match with the default or other choice. The above example shows the use of the \"other\" pattern. That said, you are allowed to leave the pattern blank if you so choose. In the example above, the pattern for the third string could easily have been written as \",one\" instead of \"other,one\" and the result will be the same. Parameters: Name Type Description argIndex * | Array.&lt;*&gt; The index into the choice array of the current parameter, or an array of indices params Object The hash of parameter values that replace the replacement variables in the string @param {boolean} useIntlPlural [optional] true if you are willing to use Intl.PluralRules object If it is omitted, the default value is true Inherited From: IString#formatChoice Throws: \"syntax error in choice format pattern: \" if there is a syntax error Returns: the formatted string Type string getLocale() Return the locale to use when processing choice formats. The locale affects how number classes are interpretted. In some cultures, the limit \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 2 to 9\" and in yet others, \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 3 or 4\". Inherited From: IString#getLocale Returns: localespec to use when processing choice formats with this string Type string includes() Same as String.includes(). Inherited From: IString#includes Returns: true if the search string is found anywhere with the given string, and false otherwise Type boolean indexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.indexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Inherited From: IString#indexOf Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number iterator() Return an iterator that will step through all of the characters in the string one at a time and return their code points, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return a code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which returns true if the iterator has more code points to iterate through, and next() which returns the next code point as a number. Inherited From: IString#iterator Returns: an iterator that iterates through all the code points in the string Type Object lastIndexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.lastIndexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Inherited From: IString#lastIndexOf Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number match(regexp) Same as String.match() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Inherited From: IString#match Returns: an array of matches Type Array.&lt;string&gt; matchAll(regexp) Same as String.matchAll() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Inherited From: IString#matchAll Returns: an iterator of the matches Type iterator normalize() Same as String.normalize(). If this JS engine does not support this method, then you can use the NormString class of ilib to the same thing (albeit a little slower).

The locale affects how number classes are interpretted. In some cultures, the limit \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 2 to 9\" and in yet others, \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 3 or 4\". Parameters: Name Type Argument Description locale Locale | string locale to use when processing choice formats with this string sync boolean &lt;optional&gt; [optional] whether to load the locale data synchronously or not loadParams Object &lt;optional&gt; [optional] parameters to pass to the loader function onLoad function &lt;optional&gt; [optional] function to call when the loading is done Inherited From: IString#setLocale slice(start, end) Same as String.slice() Parameters: Name Type Description start number first character to include in the string end number include all characters up to, but not including the end character Inherited From: IString#slice Returns: a slice of the current string Type IString split(separator, limit) Same as String.split() Parameters: Name Type Description separator string regular expression to match to find separations between the parts of the text limit number maximum number of items in the final output array.

The constructor parameters can contain any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. julianday - sets the time of this instance according to the given Julian Day instance or the Julian Day given as a float year - any integer, including 0 month - 1 to 12, where 1 means January, 2 means February, etc. day - 1 to 31 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 dst - boolean used to specify whether the given time components are intended to be in daylight time or not. This is only used in the overlap time when transitioning from DST to standard time, and the time components are ambiguous. Otherwise at all other times of the year, this flag is ignored. If you specify the date using unix time (UTC) or a julian day, then the time is already unambiguous and this flag does not need to be specified. For example, in the US, the transition out of daylight savings time in 2014 happens at Nov 2, 2014 2:00am Daylight Time, when the time falls back to Nov 2, 2014 1:00am Standard Time. If you give a date/time components as \"Nov 2, 2014 1:30am\", then there are two 1:30am times in that day, and you would have to give the standard flag to indicate which of those two you mean. (dst=true means daylight time, dst=false means standard time). timezone - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this gregorian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. locale - locale for this gregorian date. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. onLoad - a callback function to call when this date object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this date object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If the constructor is called with another Gregorian date instance instead of a parameter block, the other instance acts as a parameter block and its settings are copied into the current instance. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). If any of the properties from year through millisecond are not specified in the params, it is assumed that they have the smallest possible value in the range for the property (zero or one). new GregorianDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Gregorian date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 31. Type: number hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999. Type: number minute :number The minute of the hours. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number month :number The month number, ranging from 1 (January) to 12 (December). Type: number second :number The second of the minute. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number year :number Year in the Gregorian calendar. Type: number Methods after(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getDayOfYear() Return the ordinal day of the year. Days are counted from 1 and proceed linearly up to 365, regardless of months or weeks, etc. That is, January 1st is day 1, and December 31st is 365 in regular years, or 366 in leap years. Returns: the ordinal day of the year Type number getEra() Return the era for this date as a number. The value for the era for Gregorian calendars is -1 for \"before the common era\" (BCE) and 1 for \"the common era\" (CE). BCE dates are any date before Jan 1, 1 CE. In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, there is a year 0, so any years that are negative or zero are BCE. In the Julian calendar, there is no year 0. Instead, the calendar goes straight from year -1 to 1. Returns: 1 if this date is in the common era, -1 if it is before the common era Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day. Parameters: Name Type Description date number | JulianDay the Julian Day to use to set this date Inherited From: IDate#setJulianDay &lt;protected&gt; setRd(rd) Set the date components of this instance based on the given rd. Parameters: Name Type Description rd number the rata die date to set Inherited From: IDate#setRd setTime(millis) Set the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. Parameters: Name Type Description millis number the unix time to set this date to in milliseconds Inherited From: IDate#setTime setTimeZone( [tzName]) Set the time zone associated with this date. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tzName string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the time zone to set into this date instance, or \"undefined\" to unset the time zone Inherited From: IDate#setTimeZone × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This class encodes information about the Hebrew (Jewish) calendar. The Hebrew calendar is a tabular hebrew calendar where the dates are calculated by arithmetic rules. This differs from the religious Hebrew calendar which is used to mark the beginning of particular holidays. The religious calendar depends on the first sighting of the new crescent moon to determine the first day of the new month. Because humans and weather are both involved, the actual time of sighting varies, so it is not really possible to precalculate the religious calendar. Certain groups, such as the Hebrew Society of North America, decreed in in 2007 that they will use a calendar based on calculations rather than observations to determine the beginning of lunar months, and therefore the dates of holidays. new HebrewCal( [options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; Options governing the construction of this instance Extends Calendar Methods getMonLength(month, year) Return the number of days in a particular month in a particular year. This function can return a different number for a month depending on the year because of leap years. Parameters: Name Type Description month number the month for which the length is sought year number the year within which that month can be found Overrides: Calendar#getMonLength Returns: the number of days within the given month in the given year, or 0 for an invalid month in the year Type number getNumMonths(year) Return the number of months in the given year. The number of months in a year varies for luni-solar calendars because in some years, an extra month is needed to extend the days in a year to an entire solar year. The month is represented as a 1-based number where 1=first month, 2=second month, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description year number a year for which the number of months is sought Overrides: Calendar#getNumMonths getType() Return the type of this calendar. Overrides: Calendar#getType Returns: the name of the type of this calendar Type string isLeapYear(year) Return true if the given year is a leap year in the Hebrew calendar. The year parameter may be given as a number, or as a HebrewDate object. Parameters: Name Type Description year number | Object the year for which the leap year information is being sought Overrides: Calendar#isLeapYear Returns: true if the given year is a leap year Type boolean lastDayOfMonth(month, year) Return the date of the last day of the month for the given year. The date of the last day of the month is variable because a number of months gain an extra day in leap years, and it is variable which months gain a day for each leap year and which do not. Parameters: Name Type Description month number the month for which the number of days is sought year number the year in which that month is Returns: the number of days in the given month and year Type number &lt;static&gt; daysInYear(year) Return the number of days in the given year. Years contain a variable number of days because the date of Rosh HaShanah (New Year's) changes so that it doesn't fall on particular days of the week. Days are added to the months of Heshvan and/or Kislev in the previous year in order to prevent the current year's New Year from being on Sunday, Wednesday, or Friday.

The constructor can be called with a params object that can contain the following properties: julianday - the Julian Day to set into this date year - any integer except 0. Years go from -1 (BCE) to 1 (CE), skipping the zero year month - 1 to 12, where 1 means Nisan, 2 means Iyyar, etc. day - 1 to 30 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation parts - 0 to 1079. Specify the halaqim parts of an hour. Either specify the parts or specify the minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, but not both. minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 locale - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this julian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. timezone - the time zone of this instance. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If called with another Hebrew date argument, the date components of the given date are copied into the current one. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from julianday through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). new HebrewDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Hebrew date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 30. Type: number dayOfYear :number The day of the year. Ranges from 1 to 383. Type: number hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999. Type: number minute :number The minute of the hours. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number month :number The month number, ranging from 1 to 13. Type: number parts :number The parts (halaqim) of the hour. This can be a number from 0 to 1079. Type: number second :number The second of the minute. Ranges from 0 to 59.

Type: number Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcDateComponents() Calculate date components for the given RD date. &lt;protected&gt; _calcYear(rd) Return the year for the given RD Parameters: Name Type Description rd number RD to calculate from Returns: the year for the RD Type number after(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday() Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Overrides: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getDayOfYear() Return the ordinal day of the year. Days are counted from 1 and proceed linearly up to 385, regardless of months or weeks, etc. That is, Tishri 1st is day 1, and Elul 29 is 385 for a leap year with a long Heshvan and long Kislev. Returns: the ordinal day of the year Type number getEra() Return the era for this date as a number. The value for the era for Hebrew calendars is -1 for \"before the Hebrew era\" and 1 for \"the Hebrew era\". Hebrew era dates are any date after Tishri 1, 1, which is the same as September 7, 3760 BC in the Gregorian calendar. Returns: 1 if this date is in the Hebrew era, -1 if it is before the Hebrew era Type number getHalaqim() Get the Halaqim (parts) of an hour. There are 1080 parts in an hour, which means each part is 3.33333333 seconds long. This means the number returned may not be an integer. Returns: the halaqim parts of the current hour Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Hebrew calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Overrides: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day. Parameters: Name Type Description date number | JulianDay the Julian Day to use to set this date Inherited From: IDate#setJulianDay &lt;protected&gt; setRd(rd) Set the date components of this instance based on the given rd. Parameters: Name Type Description rd number the rata die date to set Inherited From: IDate#setRd setTime(millis) Set the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. Parameters: Name Type Description millis number the unix time to set this date to in milliseconds Inherited From: IDate#setTime setTimeZone( [tzName]) Set the time zone associated with this date. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description tzName string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the time zone to set into this date instance, or \"undefined\" to unset the time zone Inherited From: IDate#setTimeZone × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This class is different from the standard Javascript parseInt() and parseFloat() functions in that the number to be parsed can have formatting characters in it that are not supported by those two functions, and it handles numbers written in other locales properly. For example, if you pass the string \"203,231.23\" to the parseFloat() function in Javascript, it will return you the number 203. The INumber class will parse it correctly and the value() function will return the number 203231.23. If you pass parseFloat() the string \"203.231,23\" with the locale set to de-DE, it will return you 203 again. This class will return the correct number 203231.23 again. The options object may contain any of the following properties: locale - specify the locale of the string to parse. This is used to figure out what the decimal point character is. If not specified, the default locale for the app or browser is used. type - specify whether this string should be interpretted as a number, currency, or percentage amount. When the number is interpretted as a currency amount, the getCurrency() method will return something useful, otherwise it will return undefined. If the number is to be interpretted as percentage amount and there is a percentage sign in the string, then the number will be returned as a fraction from the valueOf() method. If there is no percentage sign, then the number will be returned as a regular number. That is \"58.3%\" will be returned as the number 0.583 but \"58.3\" will be returned as 58.3. Valid values for this property are \"number\", \"currency\", and \"percentage\". Default if this is not specified is \"number\". onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. This class is named INumber (\"ilib number\") so as not to conflict with the built-in Javascript Number class. new INumber(str [, options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description str string | number | INumber | Number | undefined a string to parse as a number, or a number value options Object &lt;optional&gt; Options controlling how the instance should be created Members value :number Type: number Methods getCurrency() If the type of this INumber instance is \"currency\", then the parser will attempt to figure out which currency this amount represents. The amount can be written with any of the currency signs or ISO 4217 codes that are currently recognized by ilib, and the currency signs may occur before or after the numeric portion of the string. If no currency can be recognized, then the default currency for the locale is returned. If multiple currencies can be recognized (for example if the currency sign is \"$\"), then this method will prefer the one for the current locale. If multiple currencies can be recognized, but none are used in the current locale, then the first currency encountered will be used. This may produce random results, though the larger currencies occur earlier in the list. For example, if the sign found in the string is \"$\" and that is not the sign of the currency of the current locale then the US dollar will be recognized, as it is the largest currency that uses the \"$\" as its sign. Returns: the currency instance for this amount, or undefined if this INumber object is not of type currency Type Currency | undefined getLocale() Return the locale for this formatter instance. Returns: the locale instance for this formatter Type Locale toString() Return the original string that this number instance was created with.

This string inherits from and extends the Javascript String class. It can be used almost anywhere that a normal Javascript string is used, though in some instances you will need to call the #toString method when a built-in Javascript string is needed. The formatting methods are methods that are not in the intrinsic String class and are most useful when localizing strings in an app or web site in combination with the ResBundle class. This class is named IString (\"ilib string\") so as not to conflict with the built-in Javascript String class. new IString(string) Parameters: Name Type Description string string | IString initialize this instance with this string Methods &lt;protected&gt; _toCodePoint(index) Convert the character or the surrogate pair at the given index into the string to a Unicode UCS-4 code point. Parameters: Name Type Description index number index into the string Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number charAt(index) Same as String.charAt() Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Returns: the character at the given index Type IString charCodeAt(index) Same as String.charCodeAt(). This only reports on 2-byte UCS-2 Unicode values, and does not take into account supplementary characters encoded in UTF-16. If you would like to take account of those characters, use codePointAt() instead. Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Returns: the character code of the character at the given index in the string Type number charIterator() Return an iterator that will step through all of the characters in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return that surrogate character rather than the surrogate pair which represents a character in the supplementary planes. The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which returns true if the iterator has more characters to iterate through, and next() which returns the next character. Returns: an iterator that iterates through all the characters in the string Type Object codePointAt(index) Return the code point at the given index when the string is viewed as an array of code points. If the index is beyond the end of the array of code points or if the index is negative, -1 is returned. Parameters: Name Type Description index number index of the code point Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number codePointLength() Return the number of code points in this string. This may be different than the number of characters, as the UTF-16 encoding that Javascript uses for its basis returns surrogate pairs separately. Two 2-byte surrogate characters together make up one character/code point in the supplementary character planes. If your string contains no characters in the supplementary planes, this method will return the same thing as the length() method. Returns: the number of code points in this string Type number concat(strings) Same as String.concat() Parameters: Name Type Description strings string strings to concatenate to the current one Returns: a concatenation of the given strings Type IString endsWith() Same as String.endsWith(). Returns: true if the given characters are found at the end of the string, and false otherwise Type boolean forEach(callback) Call the callback with each character in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only returns a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the surrogate character rather than the the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full character, making sure to join two surrogates into one character in the supplementary planes where necessary. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each full character in the current string forEachCodePoint(callback) Call the callback with each numeric code point in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charCodeAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full code point of each character, making sure to join two surrogates into one code point in the supplementary planes. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each code point in the current string format(params) Format this string instance as a message, replacing the parameters with the given values. The string can contain any text that a regular Javascript string can contain. Replacement parameters have the syntax: {name} Where \"name\" can be any string surrounded by curly brackets. The value of \"name\" is taken from the parameters argument. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects. If a property is missing from the parameter block, the replacement parameter substring is left untouched in the string, and a different set of parameters may be applied a second time. This way, different parts of the code may format different parts of the message that they happen to know about. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects in the {container}.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects in the {container}. The result can then be formatted again with a different parameter block that specifies a value for the container property. Parameters: Name Type Description params a Javascript object containing values for the replacement parameters in the current string Returns: a new IString instance with as many replacement parameters filled out as possible with real values. formatChoice(argIndex, params) Format a string as one of a choice of strings dependent on the value of a particular argument index or array of indices. The syntax of the choice string is as follows. The string contains a series of choices separated by a vertical bar character \"|\". Each choice has a value or range of values to match followed by a hash character \"#\" followed by the string to use if the variable matches the criteria. Example string: var num = 2; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|2#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 2 objects.\" The strings to format may contain replacement variables that will be formatted using the format() method above and the params argument as a source of values to use while formatting those variables. If the criterion for a particular choice is empty, that choice will be used as the default one for use when none of the other choice's criteria match. Example string: var num = 22; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 22 objects.\" If multiple choice patterns can match a given argument index, the first one encountered in the string will be used. If no choice patterns match the argument index, then the default choice will be used. If there is no default choice defined, then this method will return an empty string. Special Syntax For any choice format string, all of the patterns in the string should be of a single type: numeric, boolean, or string/regexp. The type of the patterns is determined by the type of the argument index parameter. If the argument index is numeric, then some special syntax can be used in the patterns to match numeric ranges. &gt;x - match any number that is greater than x &gt;=x - match any number that is greater than or equal to x &lt;x - match any number that is less than x &lt;=x - match any number that is less than or equal to x start-end - match any number in the range [start,end) zero - match any number in the class \"zero\". (See below for a description of number classes.) one - match any number in the class \"one\" two - match any number in the class \"two\" few - match any number in the class \"few\" many - match any number in the class \"many\" other - match any number in the other or default class A number class defines a set of numbers that receive a particular syntax in the strings. For example, in Slovenian, integers ending in the digit \"1\" are in the \"one\" class, including 1, 21, 31, ... 101, 111, etc. Similarly, integers ending in the digit \"2\" are in the \"two\" class. Integers ending in the digits \"3\" or \"4\" are in the \"few\" class, and every other integer is handled by the default string. The definition of what numbers are included in a class is locale-dependent. They are defined in the data file plurals.json. If your string is in a different locale than the default for ilib, you should call the setLocale() method of the string instance before calling this method. Other Pattern Types If the argument index is a boolean, the string values \"true\" and \"false\" may appear as the choice patterns. If the argument index is of type string, then the choice patterns may contain regular expressions, or static strings as degenerate regexps. Multiple Indexes If you have 2 or more indexes to format into a string, you can pass them as an array. When you do that, the patterns to match should be a comma-separate list of patterns as per the rules above. Example string: var str = new IString(\"zero,zero#There are no objects on zero pages.|one,one#There is 1 object on 1 page.|other,one#There are {number} objects on 1 page.|#There are {number} objects on {pages} pages.\"); var num = 4, pages = 1; console.log(str.formatChoice([num, pages], { number: num, pages: pages })); Gives the output: \"There are 4 objects on 1 page.\" Note that when there is a single index, you would typically leave the pattern blank to indicate the default choice. When there are multiple indices, sometimes one of the patterns has to be the default case when the other is not. Rather than leaving one or more of the patterns blank with commas that look out-of-place in the middle of it, you can use the word \"other\" to indicate a match with the default or other choice. The above example shows the use of the \"other\" pattern. That said, you are allowed to leave the pattern blank if you so choose. In the example above, the pattern for the third string could easily have been written as \",one\" instead of \"other,one\" and the result will be the same. Parameters: Name Type Description argIndex * | Array.&lt;*&gt; The index into the choice array of the current parameter, or an array of indices params Object The hash of parameter values that replace the replacement variables in the string @param {boolean} useIntlPlural [optional] true if you are willing to use Intl.PluralRules object If it is omitted, the default value is true Throws: \"syntax error in choice format pattern: \" if there is a syntax error Returns: the formatted string Type string getLocale() Return the locale to use when processing choice formats. The locale affects how number classes are interpretted. In some cultures, the limit \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 2 to 9\" and in yet others, \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 3 or 4\". Returns: localespec to use when processing choice formats with this string Type string includes() Same as String.includes(). Returns: true if the search string is found anywhere with the given string, and false otherwise Type boolean indexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.indexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number iterator() Return an iterator that will step through all of the characters in the string one at a time and return their code points, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return a code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which returns true if the iterator has more code points to iterate through, and next() which returns the next code point as a number. Returns: an iterator that iterates through all the code points in the string Type Object lastIndexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.lastIndexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number match(regexp) Same as String.match() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Returns: an array of matches Type Array.&lt;string&gt; matchAll(regexp) Same as String.matchAll() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Returns: an iterator of the matches Type iterator normalize() Same as String.normalize(). If this JS engine does not support this method, then you can use the NormString class of ilib to the same thing (albeit a little slower). Returns: the string in normalized form Type string padEnd() Same as String.padEnd(). Returns: a string of the specified length with the pad string applied at the end of the current string Type string padStart() Same as String.padStart(). Returns: a string of the specified length with the pad string applied at the end of the current string Type string repeat() Same as String.repeat(). Returns: a new string containing the specified number of copies of the given string Type string replace(searchValue, newValue) Same as String.replace() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string a regular expression to search for newValue string the string to replace the matches with Returns: a new string with all the matches replaced with the new value Type IString search(regexp) Same as String.search() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to search for Returns: position of the match, or -1 for no match Type number setLocale(locale [, sync] [, loadParams] [, onLoad]) Set the locale to use when processing choice formats. The locale affects how number classes are interpretted. In some cultures, the limit \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 2 to 9\" and in yet others, \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 3 or 4\". Parameters: Name Type Argument Description locale Locale | string locale to use when processing choice formats with this string sync boolean &lt;optional&gt; [optional] whether to load the locale data synchronously or not loadParams Object &lt;optional&gt; [optional] parameters to pass to the loader function onLoad function &lt;optional&gt; [optional] function to call when the loading is done slice(start, end) Same as String.slice() Parameters: Name Type Description start number first character to include in the string end number include all characters up to, but not including the end character Returns: a slice of the current string Type IString split(separator, limit) Same as String.split() Parameters: Name Type Description separator string regular expression to match to find separations between the parts of the text limit number maximum number of items in the final output array. Any items beyond that limit will be ignored. Returns: the parts of the current string split by the separator Type Array.&lt;string&gt; startsWith() Same as String.startsWith(). Returns: true if the given characters are found at the beginning of the string, and false otherwise Type boolean substr(start, length) Same as String.substr() Parameters: Name Type Description start number the index of the character that should begin the returned substring length number the number of characters to return after the start character. Returns: the requested substring Type IString substring(from, to) Same as String.substring() Parameters: Name Type Description from number the index of the character that should begin the returned substring to number the index where to stop the extraction. If omitted, extracts the rest of the string Returns: the requested substring Type IString toLocaleLowerCase() Same as String.toLocaleLowerCase(). If the JS engine does not support this method, you can use the ilib CaseMapper class instead. Returns: a new string representing the calling string converted to lower case, according to any locale-sensitive case mappings Type string toLocaleUpperCase() Same as String.toLocaleUpperCase(). If the JS engine does not support this method, you can use the ilib CaseMapper class instead. Returns: a new string representing the calling string converted to upper case, according to any locale-sensitive case mappings Type string toLowerCase() Same as String.toLowerCase(). Note that this method is not locale-sensitive. Returns: a string with the first character lower-cased Type IString toString() Same as String.toString() Returns: this instance as regular Javascript string Type string toUpperCase() Same as String.toUpperCase(). Note that this method is not locale-sensitive. Use toLocaleUpperCase() instead to get locale-sensitive behaviour. Returns: a string with the first character upper-cased Type IString trim() Same as String.trim(). Returns: a new string representing the calling string stripped of whitespace from both ends. Type string trimEnd() Same as String.trimEnd(). Returns: a new string representing the calling string stripped of whitespace from its (right) end. Type string trimLeft() Same as String.trimLeft().

Returns: a new string representing the calling string stripped of whitespace from its (right) end. Type string trimStart() Same as String.trimStart(). Returns: A new string representing the calling string stripped of whitespace from its beginning (left end). Type string valueOf() Same as String.valueOf() Returns: this instance as a regular Javascript string Type string &lt;static&gt; fromCodePoint(codepoint) Convert a UCS-4 code point to a Javascript string. The codepoint can be any valid UCS-4 Unicode character, including supplementary characters. Standard Javascript only supports supplementary characters using the UTF-16 encoding, which has values in the range 0x0000-0xFFFF. String.fromCharCode() will only give you a string containing 16-bit characters, and will not properly convert the code point for a supplementary character (which has a value &gt; 0xFFFF) into two UTF-16 surrogate characters. Instead, it will just just give you whatever single character happens to be the same as your code point modulo 0x10000, which is almost never what you want. Similarly, that means if you use String.charCodeAt() you will only retrieve a 16-bit value, which may possibly be a single surrogate character that is part of a surrogate pair representing a character in the supplementary plane. It will not give you a code point. Use IString.codePointAt() to access code points in a string, or use an iterator to walk through the code points in a string. Parameters: Name Type Description codepoint number UCS-4 code point to convert to a character Returns: a string containing the character represented by the codepoint Type string &lt;static&gt; loadPlurals( [sync], locale [, loadParams] [, onLoad]) Load the plural the definitions of plurals for the locale. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description sync boolean &lt;optional&gt; locale Locale | string loadParams Object &lt;optional&gt; onLoad function &lt;optional&gt; &lt;static&gt; toCodePoint(str, index) Convert the character or the surrogate pair at the given index into the intrinsic Javascript string to a Unicode UCS-4 code point. Parameters: Name Type Description str string string to get the code point from index number index into the string Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:55+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

This class encodes information about the civil Islamic calendar. The civil Islamic calendar is a tabular islamic calendar where the dates are calculated by arithmetic rules. This differs from the religious Islamic calendar which is used to mark the beginning of particular holidays. The religious calendar depends on the first sighting of the new crescent moon to determine the first day of the new month. Because humans and weather are both involved, the actual time of sighting varies, so it is not really possible to precalculate the religious calendar. Certain groups, such as the Islamic Society of North America, decreed in in 2007 that they will use a calendar based on calculations rather than observations to determine the beginning of lunar months, and therefore the dates of holidays. new IslamicCal( [options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; Options governing the construction of this instance Extends Calendar Methods getMonLength(month, year) Return the number of days in a particular month in a particular year. This function can return a different number for a month depending on the year because of things like leap years. Parameters: Name Type Description month number the month for which the length is sought year number the year within which that month can be found Overrides: Calendar#getMonLength Returns: the number of days within the given month in the given year Type number getNumMonths(year) Return the number of months in the given year. The number of months in a year varies for luni-solar calendars because in some years, an extra month is needed to extend the days in a year to an entire solar year. The month is represented as a 1-based number where 1=first month, 2=second month, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description year number a year for which the number of months is sought Overrides: Calendar#getNumMonths getType() Return the type of this calendar. Overrides: Calendar#getType Returns: the name of the type of this calendar Type string isLeapYear(year) Return true if the given year is a leap year in the Islamic calendar.

The constructor can be called with a params object that can contain the following properties: julianday - the Julian Day to set into this date year - any integer except 0. Years go from -1 (BCE) to 1 (CE), skipping the zero year month - 1 to 12, where 1 means Muharram, 2 means Saffar, etc. day - 1 to 30 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 locale - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this julian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. timezone - the time zone of this instance. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If called with another Islamic date argument, the date components of the given date are copied into the current one. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from julianday through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). new IslamicDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Islamic date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 30. Type: number dayOfYear :number The day of the year. Ranges from 1 to 355. Type: number hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999. Type: number minute :number The minute of the hours. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number month :number The month number, ranging from 1 to 12 (December).

Type: number Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcDateComponents() Calculate date components for the given RD date. &lt;protected&gt; _calcYear(rd) Return the year for the given RD Parameters: Name Type Description rd number RD to calculate from Returns: the year for the RD Type number after(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getDayOfYear() Return the ordinal day of the year. Days are counted from 1 and proceed linearly up to 354 or 355, regardless of months or weeks, etc. That is, Muharran 1st is day 1, and Dhu al-Hijja 29 is 354. Returns: the ordinal day of the year Type number getEra() Return the era for this date as a number. The value for the era for Islamic calendars is -1 for \"before the Islamic era\" and 1 for \"the Islamic era\". Islamic era dates are any date after Muharran 1, 1, which is the same as July 16, 622 CE in the Gregorian calendar. Returns: 1 if this date is in the common era, -1 if it is before the common era Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number &lt;protected&gt; newRd( [params]) Return a new RD for this date type using the given params. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; the parameters used to create this rata die instance Returns: the new RD instance for the given params Type RataDie onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day. Parameters: Name Type Description date number | JulianDay the Julian Day to use to set this date Inherited From: IDate#setJulianDay &lt;protected&gt; setRd(rd) Set the date components of this instance based on the given rd. Parameters: Name Type Description rd number the rata die date to set Inherited From: IDate#setRd setTime(millis) Set the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970.

This function can return a different number for a month depending on the year because of things like leap years. Parameters: Name Type Description month number the month for which the length is sought year number the year within which that month can be found Overrides: Calendar#getMonLength Returns: the number of days within the given month in the given year Type number getNumMonths(year) Return the number of months in the given year. The number of months in a year varies for lunar calendars because in some years, an extra month is needed to extend the days in a year to an entire solar year. The month is represented as a 1-based number where 1=Jaunary, 2=February, etc. until 12=December. Parameters: Name Type Description year number a year for which the number of months is sought Overrides: Calendar#getNumMonths getType() Return the type of this calendar. Overrides: Calendar#getType Returns: the name of the type of this calendar Type string isLeapYear(year) Return true if the given year is a leap year in the Julian calendar.

The constructor can be called with a parameter object that contains any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 (Gregorian). julianday - the Julian Day to set into this date year - any integer except 0. Years go from -1 (BCE) to 1 (CE), skipping the zero year which doesn't exist in the Julian calendar month - 1 to 12, where 1 means January, 2 means February, etc. day - 1 to 31 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 locale - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this julian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. timezone - the time zone of this instance. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. NB. The Julian Day (JulianDay) object is a different object than a date in the Julian calendar and the two are not to be confused. The Julian Day object represents time as a number of whole and fractional days since the beginning of the epoch, whereas a date in the Julian calendar is a regular date that signifies year, month, day, etc. using the rules of the Julian calendar. The naming of Julian Days and the Julian calendar are unfortunately close, and come from history. If called with another Julian date argument, the date components of the given date are copied into the current one. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). new JulianDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Julian date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 31. Type: number dayOfYear :number The day of the year. Ranges from 1 to 383. Type: number hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999. Type: number minute :number The minute of the hours. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number month :number The month number, ranging from 1 (January) to 12 (December). Type: number second :number The second of the minute. Ranges from 0 to 59. Type: number year :number Year in the Julian calendar. Type: number Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcDateComponents() Calculate date components for the given RD date. &lt;protected&gt; _calcYear(rd) Return the year for the given RD Parameters: Name Type Description rd number RD to calculate from Returns: the year for the RD Type number after(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number &lt;protected&gt; newRd( [params]) Return a new RD for this date type using the given params. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; the parameters used to create this rata die instance Returns: the new RD instance for the given params Type RataDie onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day.

Parameters: Name Type Description rd number the rata die date to set Inherited From: IDate#setRd setTime(millis) Set the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. Parameters: Name Type Description millis number the unix time to set this date to in milliseconds Inherited From: IDate#setTime setTimeZone( [tzName]) Set the time zone associated with this date.

A Julian Day is a date based on the Julian Day count of time invented by Joseph Scaliger in 1583 for use with astronomical calculations. Do not confuse it with a date in the Julian calendar, which it has very little in common with. The naming is unfortunately close, and comes from history. new JulianDay(num) Parameters: Name Type Description num number the Julian Day expressed as a floating point number Methods addDate(offset) Add an offset to the current date instance. The offset should be expressed in terms of Julian days. That is, each integral unit represents one day of time, and fractional part represents a fraction of a regular 24-hour day. Parameters: Name Type Description offset number an amount to add (or subtract) to the current result instance. getDate() Return the Julian Day expressed as a floating point number. Returns: the Julian Day as a number Type number getDayFraction() Return the fractional portion of this Julian Day instance. This portion corresponds to the time of day for the instance. getDays() Return the integral portion of this Julian Day instance. This corresponds to the number of days since the beginning of the epoch. Returns: the integral portion of this Julian Day Type number setDate(num) Set the date of this Julian Day instance. Parameters: Name Type Description num number the numeric Julian Day to set into this instance setDayFraction(fraction) Set the fractional part of the Julian Day. The fractional part represents the portion of a fully day. Julian dates start at noon, and proceed until noon of the next day. That would mean midnight is represented as a fractional part of 0.5. Parameters: Name Type Description fraction number The fractional part of the Julian date setDays(days) Set the date of this Julian Day instance.

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description to string the name of the units to convert this measurement to Inherited From: Measurement#convert Returns: the amount corresponding to the requested unit Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;optional&gt; object containing a mapping between the measurement system and an array of units to use to restrict the expansion to constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#expand Returns: an array of new measurements in order from the current units to the smallest units in the system which together are the same measurement as this one Type Array.&lt;Measurement&gt; getAmount() Return the numeric amount of this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder.

If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the system to scale to units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling. If this is not defined, this measurement type will use the set of units that it knows about for the given measurement system Inherited From: Measurement#scale Returns: a new instance that is scaled to the right level Type Measurement &lt;static&gt; convert(to, from, length) Convert a length to another measure.

The options object can contain zero or more of the following parameters: locale locale to use to format this list, or undefined to use the default locale length - Specify the length of the format to use. The length is the approximate size of the formatted string. short medium long full style the name of style to use to format the list, or undefined to use the default \"conjunction\" style.

This is the default style for \"standard\". disjunction this list should be concatenated with a disjunction \"or\". unit this is a list of measures like \"5 minutes, 4 seconds\". In some languages, these type of lists are concatenated without a conjunction. onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale data is fully loaded and the address has been parsed. When the onLoad option is given, the address formatter object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing.

Locales are specified either with a specifier string that follows the BCP-47 convention (roughly: \"language-region-script-variant\") or with 4 parameters that specify the language, region, variant, and script individually. The language is given as an ISO 639-1 two-letter, lower-case language code. You can find a full list of these codes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes The region is given as an ISO 3166-1 two-letter, upper-case region code. You can find a full list of these codes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2. The variant is any string that does not contain a dash which further differentiates locales from each other. The script is given as the ISO 15924 four-letter script code. In some locales, text may be validly written in more than one script. For example, Serbian is often written in both Latin and Cyrillic, though not usually mixed together. You can find a full list of these codes at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924#List_of_codes. As an example in ilib, the script can be used in the date formatter. Dates formatted in Serbian could have day-of-week names or month names written in the Latin or Cyrillic script. Often one script is default such that sr-SR-Latn is the same as sr-SR so the script code \"Latn\" can be left off of the locale spec. Each part is optional, and an empty string in the specifier before or after a dash or as a parameter to the constructor denotes an unspecified value. In this case, many of the ilib functions will treat the locale as generic. For example the locale \"en-\" is equivalent to \"en\" and to \"en--\" and denotes a locale of \"English\" with an unspecified region and variant, which typically matches any region or variant. Without any arguments to the constructor, this function returns the locale of the host Javascript engine. new Locale(language [, region] [, variant] [, script]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description language string | Locale the ISO 639 2-letter code for the language, or a full locale spec in BCP-47 format, or another Locale instance to copy from region string &lt;optional&gt; the ISO 3166 2-letter code for the region variant string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the variant of this locale, if any script string &lt;optional&gt; the ISO 15924 code of the script for this locale, if any Methods equals() Return true if the the other locale is exactly equal to the current one. Returns: whether or not the other locale is equal to the current one Type boolean getLangSpec() Return the language locale specifier. This includes the language and the script if it is available. This can be used to see whether the written language of two locales match each other regardless of the region or variant. Returns: the language locale specifier Type string getLanguage() Return the ISO 639 language code for this locale. Returns: the language code for this locale Type string | undefined getLanguageAlpha3() Return the language of this locale as an ISO-639-alpha3 language code Returns: the alpha3 language code of this locale Type string | undefined getRegion() Return the ISO 3166 region code for this locale. Returns: the region code of this locale Type string | undefined getRegionAlpha3() Return the region of this locale as an ISO-3166-alpha3 region code Returns: the alpha3 region code of this locale Type string | undefined getScript() Return the ISO 15924 script code for this locale Returns: the script code of this locale Type string | undefined getSpec() Return the whole locale specifier as a string. Returns: the locale specifier Type string getVariant() Return the variant code for this locale Returns: the variant code of this locale, if any Type string | undefined isPseudo() Return true if the current locale is the special pseudo locale. Returns: true if the current locale is the special pseudo locale Type boolean isValid() Return true if the current locale uses a valid ISO codes for each component of the locale that exists. Returns: true if the current locale has all valid components, and false otherwise. Type boolean toString() Express this locale object as a string. Currently, this simply calls the getSpec function to represent the locale as its specifier. Returns: the locale specifier Type string &lt;static&gt; getAvailableLocales(sync, onLoad) Return the list of available locales that this iLib file supports. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled with locale data, then the list locales may be much smaller than the list of all available locales in the iLib repository. The assembly tool will automatically fill in the list for an assembled copy of iLib. If this copy is being used with dynamically loaded data, then you can load any locale that iLib supports. You can form a locale with any combination of a language and region tags that exist in the locale data directory. Language tags are in the root of the locale data dir, and region tags can be found underneath the \"und\" directory. (The region tags are separated into a different dir because the region names conflict with language names on file systems that are case-insensitive.) If you have culled the locale data directory to limit the size of your app, then this function should return only those files that actually exist according to the ilibmanifest.json file in the root of that locale data dir. Make sure your ilibmanifest.json file is up-to-date with respect to the list of files that exist in the locale data dir. Parameters: Name Type Description sync boolean if false, load the list of available files from disk asynchronously, otherwise load them synchronously. (Default: true/synchronously) onLoad function a callback function to call if asynchronous load was requested and the list of files have been loaded. Returns: this is an array of locale specs for which this iLib file has locale data for Type Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;static&gt; languageAlpha1ToAlpha3(alpha1) Return the ISO-639 alpha3 equivalent language code for the given ISO 639 alpha1 language code. If the given alpha1 code is not found, this function returns its argument unchanged. Parameters: Name Type Description alpha1 string | undefined the alpha1 code to map Returns: the alpha3 equivalent of the given alpha1 code, or the alpha1 parameter if the alpha1 value is not found Type string | undefined &lt;static&gt; regionAlpha2ToAlpha3(alpha2) Return the ISO-3166 alpha3 equivalent region code for the given ISO 3166 alpha2 region code. If the given alpha2 code is not found, this function returns its argument unchanged. Parameters: Name Type Description alpha2 string | undefined the alpha2 code to map Returns: the alpha3 equivalent of the given alpha2 code, or the alpha2 parameter if the alpha2 value is not found Type string | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

Locale info instances give information about the default settings for a particular locale. These settings may be overridden by various parts of the code, and should be used as a fall-back setting of last resort. The optional options object holds extra parameters if they are necessary. The current list of supported options are: onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale info object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the localeinfo object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. If this copy of ilib is pre-assembled and all the data is already available, or if the data was already previously loaded, then this constructor will call the onLoad callback immediately when the initialization is done. If the onLoad option is not given, this class will only attempt to load any missing locale data synchronously. new LocaleInfo(locale [, options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description locale Locale | string the locale for which the info is sought, or undefined for options Object &lt;optional&gt; the locale for which the info is sought, or undefined for the current locale See: {ilib.setLoaderCallback} for information about registering a loader callback function Methods getAllScripts() Return an array of script codes which are used to write text in the current language. Text for most languages is written in only one script, but there are some languages where the text can be written in a number of scripts, depending on a variety of things such as the region, ethnicity, religion, etc. of the author. This method returns an array of script codes in which the language is commonly written. Returns: an array of ISO 15924 codes for the scripts used to write text in this language Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that is commonly used in the given locale. Returns: The name of the calendar commonly used in the locale Type string getClock() Return whether this locale commonly uses the 12- or the 24-hour clock. Returns: \"12\" if the locale commonly uses a 12-hour clock, or \"24\" if the locale commonly uses a 24-hour clock. Type string getCurrency() Return the currency that is legal in the locale, or which is most commonly used in regular commerce. Returns: the ISO 4217 code for the currency of this locale Type string getCurrencyFormats() Return an object containing the format templates for formatting currencies in this locale. The object has a number of properties in it that each are a particular style of format. Normally, this contains a \"common\" and an \"iso\" style, but may contain others in the future. Returns: an object containing the format templates for currencies Type Object getDecimalSeparator() Return the decimal separator for formatted numbers in this locale. Returns: the decimal separator char Type string getDefaultScript() Return the default script used to write text in the language of this locale. Text for most languages is written in only one script, but there are some languages where the text can be written in a number of scripts, depending on a variety of things such as the region, ethnicity, religion, etc. of the author. This method returns the default script for the locale, in which the language is most commonly written. The script is returned as an ISO 15924 4-letter code. Returns: the ISO 15924 code for the default script used to write text in this locale Type string getDelimiterQuotationEnd() Return the default Delimiter QuotationEnd information in this locale. Returns: default QuotationEnd in this locale Type string getDelimiterQuotationStart() Return the default Delimiter QuotationStart information in this locale. Returns: default QuotationStart in this locale Type string getDigits() Return the digits of the default script if they are defined. If not defined, the default should be the regular \"Arabic numerals\" used in the Latin script. (0-9) Returns: the digits used in the default script Type string | undefined getDigitsStyle() Return a string that describes the style of digits used by this locale. Possible return values are: western - uses the regular western 10-based digits 0 through 9 optional - native 10-based digits exist, but in modern usage, this locale most often uses western digits native - native 10-based native digits exist and are used regularly by this locale custom - uses native digits by default that are not 10-based Returns: string that describes the style of digits used in this locale Type string getExponential() Return the symbol used for exponential in this locale. Returns: the symbol used for exponential in this locale Type string getFirstDayOfWeek() Return the day of week that starts weeks in the current locale. Days are still numbered the standard way with 0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday, but calendars should be displayed and weeks calculated with the day of week returned from this function as the first day of the week. Returns: the day of the week that starts weeks in the current locale. Type number getGroupingSeparator() Return the separator character used to separate groups of digits on the integer side of the decimal character. Returns: the grouping separator char Type string getLanguageName() Return the name of the locale's language in English. Returns: the name of the locale's language in English Type string getLocale() Return the locale that this info object was created with. Returns: The locale spec of the locale used to construct this info instance Type Locale getMeridiemsStyle() Return the default style of meridiems used in this locale. Meridiems are times of day like AM/PM. In a few locales with some calendars, for example Amharic/Ethiopia using the Ethiopic calendar, the times of day may be split into different segments than simple AM/PM as in the Gregorian calendar. Only a few locales are like that. For most locales, formatting a Gregorian date will use the regular Gregorian AM/PM meridiems. Returns: the default meridiems style used in this locale. Possible values are \"gregorian\", \"chinese\", and \"ethiopic\" Type string getNativeDecimalSeparator() Return the decimal separator for formatted numbers in this locale for native script. Returns: the decimal separator char Type string getNativeDigits() Return the digits of the native script if they are defined. Returns: the digits used in the default script Type string | undefined getNativeExponential() Return the symbol used for exponential in this locale for native script. Returns: the symbol used for exponential in this locale for native script Type string getNativeGroupingSeparator() Return the separator character used to separate groups of digits on the integer side of the decimal character for the native script if present other than the default script. Returns: the grouping separator char Type string getNativePercentageSymbol() Return the symbol used for percentages in this locale for native script. Returns: the symbol used for percentages in this locale for native script Type string getNegativeNumberFormat() Return the format template used to format negative numbers in this locale. Returns: the format template for formatting negative numbers Type string getNegativePercentageFormat() Return the format template used to format percentages in this locale with negative amounts. Returns: the format template for formatting percentages Type string getPaperSize() Return the default PaperSize information in this locale. Returns: default PaperSize in this locale Type string getPercentageFormat() Return the format template used to format percentages in this locale. Returns: the format template for formatting percentages Type string getPercentageSymbol() Return the symbol used for percentages in this locale. Returns: the symbol used for percentages in this locale Type string getPrimaryGroupingDigits() Return the minimum number of digits grouped together on the integer side for the first (primary) group. In western European cultures, groupings are in 1000s, so the number of digits is 3. Returns: the number of digits in a primary grouping, or 0 for no grouping Type number getRegionName() Return the name of the locale's region in English. If the locale has no region, this returns undefined. Returns: the name of the locale's region in English Type string | undefined getRoundingMode() If this locale typically uses a different type of rounding for numeric formatting other than halfdown, especially for currency, then it can be specified in the localeinfo. If the locale uses the default, then this method returns undefined. The locale's rounding method overrides the rounding method for the currency itself, which can sometimes shared between various locales so it is less specific. Returns: the name of the rounding mode typically used in this locale, or \"halfdown\" if the locale does not override the default Type string getScript() Return the script used for the current locale. If the current locale explicitly defines a script, then this script is returned. If not, then the default script for the locale is returned. See: LocaleInfo.getDefaultScript Returns: the ISO 15924 code for the script used to write text in this locale Type string getSecondaryGroupingDigits() Return the minimum number of digits grouped together on the integer side for the second or more (secondary) group. In western European cultures, all groupings are by 1000s, so the secondary size should be 0 because there is no secondary size. In general, if this method returns 0, then all groupings are of the primary size. For some other cultures, the first grouping (primary) is 3 and any subsequent groupings (secondary) are two. So, 100000 would be written as: \"1,00,000\". Returns: the number of digits in a secondary grouping, or 0 for no secondary grouping. Type number getTimeZone() Return the default time zone for this locale. Many locales span across multiple time zones. In this case, the time zone with the largest population is chosen to represent the locale. This is obviously not that accurate, but then again, this method's return value should only be used as a default anyways. Returns: the default time zone for this locale. Type string getUnits() Return the name of the measuring system that is commonly used in the given locale. Valid values are \"uscustomary\", \"imperial\", and \"metric\". Returns: The name of the measuring system commonly used in the locale Type string getWeekEndEnd() Return the day of week that starts weekend in the current locale. Days are still numbered the standard way with 0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday. Returns: the day of the week that starts weeks in the current locale. Type number getWeekEndStart() Return the day of week that starts weekend in the current locale. Days are still numbered the standard way with 0 for Sunday through 6 for Saturday. Returns: the day of the week that starts weeks in the current locale.

This is used to see which locales can be matched with each other in various ways. The options object may contain any of the following properties: locale - the locale instance or locale spec to match onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale matcher object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the locale matcher object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously.

The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new LocaleMatcher(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object parameters to initialize this matcher Members info :Object.&lt;string, string&gt; Type: Object.&lt;string, string&gt; Methods getLikelyLocale() Return an Locale instance that is fully specified based on partial information given to the constructor of this locale matcher instance. For example, if the locale spec given to this locale matcher instance is simply \"ru\" (for the Russian language), then it will fill in the missing region and script tags and return a locale with the specifier \"ru-Cyrl-RU\". (ie. Russian language, Cyrillic, Russian Federation). Any one or two of the language, script, or region parts may be left unspecified, and the other one or two parts will be filled in automatically. If this class has no information about the given locale, then the locale of this locale matcher instance is returned unchanged. Returns: the most likely completion of the partial locale given to the constructor of this locale matcher instance Type Locale getLikelyLocaleMinimal() Return an Locale instance that is specified based on partial information given to the constructor of this locale matcher instance but which leaves out any part of the locale specifier that is so common that it is understood. For example, if the locale spec given to this locale matcher instance is simply \"ru\" (for the Russian language), then it will fill in the missing region and/or script tags and return a locale with the specifier \"ru-RU\". (ie. Russian language, Russian Federation). Note that the default script \"Cyrl\" is left out because the vast majority of text written in Russian is written with the Cyrllic script, so that part of the locale is understood and is commonly left out. Any one or two of the language, script, or region parts may be left unspecified, and the other one or two parts will be filled in automatically. If this class has no information about the given locale, then the locale of this locale matcher instance is returned unchanged. This method returns the same information as getLikelyLocale but with the very common parts left out. Returns: the most likely \"minimal\" completion of the partial locale given to the constructor of this locale matcher instance where the commonly understood parts are left out. Type Locale getLocale() Return the locale used to construct this instance. Returns: the locale for this matcher Type Locale | undefined getMacroLanguage() Return the macrolanguage associated with this locale. If the locale's language is not part of a macro-language, then the locale's language is returned as-is. Returns: the ISO code for the macrolanguage associated with this locale, or language of the locale Type string getRegionContainment() Return the list of regions that this locale is contained within. Regions are nested, so locales can be in multiple regions. (eg. US is in Northern North America, North America, the Americas, the World.) Most regions are specified using UN.49 region numbers, though some, like \"EU\", are letters. If the locale is underspecified, this method will use the most likely locale method to get the region first. For example, the locale \"ja\" (Japanese) is most likely \"ja-JP\" (Japanese for Japan), and the region containment info for Japan is returned. Returns: an array of region specifiers that this locale is within Type Array.&lt;string&gt; match(locale) Return the degree that the given locale matches the current locale of this matcher. This method returns an integer from 0 to 100. A value of 100 is a 100% match, meaning that the two locales are exactly equivalent to each other. (eg. \"ja-JP\" and \"ja-JP\") A value of 0 means that there 0% match or that the two locales have nothing in common. (eg. \"en-US\" and \"ja-JP\") Locale matching is not the same as equivalence, as the degree of matching is returned. (See Locale.equals for equivalence.) The match score is calculated based on matching the 4 locale components, weighted by importance: language - this accounts for 50% of the match score region - accounts for 25% of the match score script - accounts for 20% of the match score variant - accounts for 5% of the match score The score is affected by the following things: A large language score is given when the language components of the locales match exactly. Higher language scores are given when the languages are linguistically close to each other, such as dialects. A small score is given when two languages are in the same linguistic family, but one is not a dialect of the other, such as German and Dutch. A large region score is given when two locales share the same region. A smaller region score is given when one region is contained within another. For example, Hong Kong is part of China, so a moderate score is given instead of a full score. A small score is given if two regions are geographically close to each other or are tied by history. For example, Ireland and Great Britain are both adjacent and tied by history, so they receive a moderate score. A high script score is given if the two locales share the same script. The legibility of a common script means that there is some small kinship of the different languages. A high variant score is given if the two locales share the same variant. Full score is given when both locales have no variant at all. Locale components that are unspecified in both locales are given high scores. Locales where a particular locale component is missing in only one locale can still match when the default for that locale component matches the component in the other locale. The default value for the missing component is determined using the likely locales data. (See getLikelyLocale()) For example, \"en-US\" and \"en-Latn-US\" receive a high script score because the default script for \"en\" is \"Latn\". The intention of this method is that it can be used to determine compatibility of locales. For example, when a user signs up for an account on a web site, the locales that the web site supports and the locale of the user's browser may differ, and the site needs to pick the best locale to show the user. Let's say the web site supports a selection of European languages such as \"it-IT\", \"fr-FR\", \"de-DE\", and \"en-GB\". The user's browser may be set to \"it-CH\". The web site code can then match \"it-CH\" against each of the supported locales to find the one with the highest score. In this case, the best match would be \"it-IT\" because it shares a language and script in common with \"it-CH\" and differs only in the region component. It is not a 100% match, but it is pretty good. The web site may decide if the match scores all fall below a chosen threshold (perhaps 50%?), it should show the user the default language \"en-GB\", because that is probably a better choice than any other supported locale. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale the other locale to match against the current one Returns: an integer from 0 to 100 that indicates the degree to which these locales match each other Type number smallestCommonRegion(otherLocale) Find the smallest region that contains both the current locale and the other locale. If the current or other locales are underspecified, this method will use the most likely locale method to get their regions first. For example, the locale \"ja\" (Japanese) is most likely \"ja-JP\" (Japanese for Japan), and the region containment info for Japan is checked against the other locale's region containment info. Parameters: Name Type Description otherLocale string | Locale a locale specifier or a Locale instance to compare against Returns: the region specifier of the smallest region containing both the current locale and other locale Type string × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description to string the name of the units to convert this measurement to Inherited From: Measurement#convert Returns: the amount corresponding to the requested unit Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;optional&gt; object containing a mapping between the measurement system and an array of units to use to restrict the expansion to constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit.

Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the system to scale to units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling. If this is not defined, this measurement type will use the set of units that it knows about for the given measurement system Inherited From: Measurement#scale Returns: a new instance that is scaled to the right level Type Measurement &lt;static&gt; convert(to, from, mass) Convert a mass to another measure. Parameters: Name Type Description to string unit to convert to from string unit to convert from mass number amount to be convert Returns: the converted amount Type number | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

Different locales have different conventions when it comes to naming people. The options can contain any of the following properties: locale - use the rules and conventions of the given locale in order to parse the name style - explicitly use the named style to parse the name. Valid values so far are \"western\" and \"asian\". If this property is not specified, then the style will be gleaned from the name itself. This class will count the total number of Latin or Asian characters. If the majority of the characters are in one style, that style will be used to parse the whole name. order - explicitly use the given order for names. In some locales, such as Russian, names may be written equally validly as \"givenName familyName\" or \"familyName givenName\". This option tells the parser which order to prefer, and overrides the default order for the locale. Valid values are \"gf\" (given-family) or \"fg\" (family-given). useSpaces - explicitly specifies whether to use spaces or not between the given name , middle name and family name. compoundFamilyName - for Asian and some other types of names, search for compound family names. If this parameter is not specified, the default is to use the setting that is most common for the locale. If it is specified, the locale default is overridden with this flag. onLoad - a callback function to call when the name info is fully loaded and the name has been parsed. When the onLoad option is given, the name object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Additionally, a name instance can be constructed by giving the explicit already-parsed fields or by using another name instance as the parameter. (That is, it becomes a copy constructor.) The name fields can be any of the following: prefix - the prefix prepended to the name givenName - the person's given or \"first\" name middleName - one or more middle names, separated by spaces even if the language doesn't use usually use spaces. The spaces are merely separators. familyName - one or more family or \"last\" names, separated by spaces even if the language doesn't use usually use spaces. The spaces are merely separators. suffix - the suffix appended to the name honorific - the honorific title of the name. This could be formatted as a prefix or a suffix, depending on the customs of the particular locale. You should only give either an honorific or a prefix/suffix, but not both. When the parser has completed its parsing, it fills in the same fields as listed above. For names that include auxilliary words, such as the family name \"van der Heijden\", all of the auxilliary words (\"van der\") will be included in the field. For names in some Spanish locales, it is assumed that the family name is doubled. That is, a person may have a paternal family name followed by a maternal family name. All family names will be listed in the familyName field as normal, separated by spaces. When formatting the short version of such names, only the paternal family name is used. new Name(name [, options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description name string | Name | Object the name to parse options Object &lt;optional&gt; Options governing the construction of this name instance Members familyName :string|Array.&lt;string&gt; The family names in this name.

In English, names are always sorted by initial characters. In places like the Netherlands or Germany, family names are sorted by the head word of a list of names rather than the first element of that name. Returns: a string containing the family name[s] to be used for sorting in the current locale, or undefined if there is no family name in this object Type string | undefined &lt;protected, static&gt; _isAsianChar() Return true if the given character is in the range of the Han, Hangul, or kana scripts. &lt;protected, static&gt; _isAsianName() &lt;protected, static&gt; _isEuroName() Return true if any Latin letters are found in the string.

The options may contain the following properties: locale - Use the conventions of the given locale to construct the name format. style - Format the name with the given style. The value of this property should be one of the following strings: short - Format a short name with just the given and family names. eg. \"John Smith\" medium - Format a medium-length name with the given, middle, and family names. eg. \"John James Smith\" long - Format a long name with all names available in the given name object, including prefixes. eg. \"Mr. John James Smith\" full - Format a long name with all names available in the given name object, including prefixes and suffixes. eg. \"Mr. John James Smith, Jr.\" formal_short - Format a name with the honorific or prefix/suffix and the family name. eg. \"Mr. Smith\" formal_long - Format a name with the honorific or prefix/suffix and the given and family name. eg. \"Mr. John Smith\" familiar - Format a name with the most familiar style that the culture of the locale will accept. In some locales, it is not rude to address people you just met by their given name. In others, it is rude to address a person in such a familiar style unless you are previously invited to do so or unless you have known them for a while. In this case, it will use a more formal style, but still as familiar as possible so as not to be rude. components - Format the name with the given components in the correct order for those components. Components are encoded as a string of letters representing the desired components: p - prefixes g - given name m - middle names f - family name s - suffixes h - honorifics (selects the prefix or suffix as required by the locale) For example, the string \"pf\" would mean to only format any prefixes and family names together and leave out all the other parts of the name. The components can be listed in any order in the string. The components option overrides the style option if both are specified. onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale info object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the localeinfo object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Formatting names is a locale-dependent function, as the order of the components depends on the locale. The following explains some of the details: In Western countries, the given name comes first, followed by a space, followed by the family name. In Asian countries, the family name comes first, followed immediately by the given name with no space. But, that format is only used with Asian names written in ideographic characters. In Asian countries, especially ones where both an Asian and a Western language are used (Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.), the convention is often to follow the language of the name. That is, Asian names are written in Asian style, and Western names are written in Western style. This class follows that convention as well. In other Asian countries, Asian names written in Latin script are written with Asian ordering. eg. \"Xu Ping-an\" instead of the more Western order \"Ping-an Xu\", as the order is thought to go with the style that is appropriate for the name rather than the style for the language being written. In some Spanish speaking countries, people often take both their maternal and paternal last names as their own family name. When formatting a short or medium style of that family name, only the paternal name is used. In the long style, all the names are used. eg. \"Juan Julio Raul Lopez Ortiz\" took the name \"Lopez\" from his father and the name \"Ortiz\" from his mother. His family name would be \"Lopez Ortiz\". The formatted short style of his name would be simply \"Juan Lopez\" which only uses his paternal family name of \"Lopez\". In many Western languages, it is common to use auxillary words in family names. For example, the family name of \"Ludwig von Beethoven\" in German is \"von Beethoven\", not \"Beethoven\". This class ensures that the family name is formatted correctly with all auxillary words. new NameFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object A set of options that govern how the formatter will behave Methods &lt;protected&gt; _adjoinAuxillaries() adjoin auxillary words to their head words &lt;protected&gt; _init() format(name) Format the name for display in the current locale with the options set up in the constructor of this formatter instance. If the name does not contain all the parts required for the style, those parts will be left blank. There are two basic styles of formatting: European, and Asian. If this formatter object is set for European style, but an Asian name is passed to the format method, then this method will format the Asian name with a generic Asian template. Similarly, if the formatter is set for an Asian style, and a European name is passed to the format method, the formatter will use a generic European template. This means it is always safe to format any name with a formatter for any locale. You should always get something at least reasonable as output. Parameters: Name Type Description name Name | Object the name instance to format, or an object containing name parts to format Returns: the name formatted according to the style of this formatter instance Type string | undefined getComponents() Return the list of components used to format names in this formatter Returns: the list of components Type string getLocale() Return the locale for this formatter instance.

This string inherits from the GlyphString class, and adds the normalize method. It can be used anywhere that a normal Javascript string is used. The options parameter is optional, and may contain any combination of the following properties: onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale data are fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously.

Parameters: Name Type Description index number index into the string Inherited From: IString#_toCodePoint Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number charAt(index) Same as String.charAt() Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Inherited From: IString#charAt Returns: the character at the given index Type IString charCodeAt(index) Same as String.charCodeAt(). This only reports on 2-byte UCS-2 Unicode values, and does not take into account supplementary characters encoded in UTF-16. If you would like to take account of those characters, use codePointAt() instead. Parameters: Name Type Description index number the index of the character being sought Inherited From: IString#charCodeAt Returns: the character code of the character at the given index in the string Type number codePointAt(index) Return the code point at the given index when the string is viewed as an array of code points. If the index is beyond the end of the array of code points or if the index is negative, -1 is returned. Parameters: Name Type Description index number index of the code point Inherited From: IString#codePointAt Returns: code point of the character at the given index into the string Type number codePointLength() Return the number of code points in this string. This may be different than the number of characters, as the UTF-16 encoding that Javascript uses for its basis returns surrogate pairs separately. Two 2-byte surrogate characters together make up one character/code point in the supplementary character planes. If your string contains no characters in the supplementary planes, this method will return the same thing as the length() method. Inherited From: IString#codePointLength Returns: the number of code points in this string Type number concat(strings) Same as String.concat() Parameters: Name Type Description strings string strings to concatenate to the current one Inherited From: IString#concat Returns: a concatenation of the given strings Type IString ellipsize(length) Truncate the current string at the given number of glyphs and add an ellipsis to indicate that is more to the string. The ellipsis forms the last character in the string, so the string is actually truncated at length-1 glyphs. Parameters: Name Type Description length number the number of whole glyphs to keep in the string including the ellipsis Inherited From: GlyphString#ellipsize Returns: a string truncated to the requested number of glyphs with an ellipsis Type string endsWith() Same as String.endsWith(). Inherited From: IString#endsWith Returns: true if the given characters are found at the end of the string, and false otherwise Type boolean forEach(callback) Call the callback with each character in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charAt() method only returns a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the surrogate character rather than the the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full character, making sure to join two surrogates into one character in the supplementary planes where necessary. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each full character in the current string Inherited From: IString#forEach forEachCodePoint(callback) Call the callback with each numeric code point in the string one at a time, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in the UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index to charCodeAt() is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return the code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. This function will call the callback with the full code point of each character, making sure to join two surrogates into one code point in the supplementary planes. Parameters: Name Type Description callback function a callback function to call with each code point in the current string Inherited From: IString#forEachCodePoint format(params) Format this string instance as a message, replacing the parameters with the given values. The string can contain any text that a regular Javascript string can contain. Replacement parameters have the syntax: {name} Where \"name\" can be any string surrounded by curly brackets. The value of \"name\" is taken from the parameters argument. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects. If a property is missing from the parameter block, the replacement parameter substring is left untouched in the string, and a different set of parameters may be applied a second time. This way, different parts of the code may format different parts of the message that they happen to know about. Example: var str = new IString(\"There are {num} objects in the {container}.\"); console.log(str.format({ num: 12 }); Would give the output: There are 12 objects in the {container}. The result can then be formatted again with a different parameter block that specifies a value for the container property. Parameters: Name Type Description params a Javascript object containing values for the replacement parameters in the current string Inherited From: IString#format Returns: a new IString instance with as many replacement parameters filled out as possible with real values. formatChoice(argIndex, params) Format a string as one of a choice of strings dependent on the value of a particular argument index or array of indices. The syntax of the choice string is as follows. The string contains a series of choices separated by a vertical bar character \"|\". Each choice has a value or range of values to match followed by a hash character \"#\" followed by the string to use if the variable matches the criteria. Example string: var num = 2; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|2#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 2 objects.\" The strings to format may contain replacement variables that will be formatted using the format() method above and the params argument as a source of values to use while formatting those variables. If the criterion for a particular choice is empty, that choice will be used as the default one for use when none of the other choice's criteria match. Example string: var num = 22; var str = new IString(\"0#There are no objects.|1#There is one object.|#There are {number} objects.\"); console.log(str.formatChoice(num, { number: num })); Gives the output: \"There are 22 objects.\" If multiple choice patterns can match a given argument index, the first one encountered in the string will be used. If no choice patterns match the argument index, then the default choice will be used. If there is no default choice defined, then this method will return an empty string. Special Syntax For any choice format string, all of the patterns in the string should be of a single type: numeric, boolean, or string/regexp. The type of the patterns is determined by the type of the argument index parameter. If the argument index is numeric, then some special syntax can be used in the patterns to match numeric ranges. &gt;x - match any number that is greater than x &gt;=x - match any number that is greater than or equal to x &lt;x - match any number that is less than x &lt;=x - match any number that is less than or equal to x start-end - match any number in the range [start,end) zero - match any number in the class \"zero\". (See below for a description of number classes.) one - match any number in the class \"one\" two - match any number in the class \"two\" few - match any number in the class \"few\" many - match any number in the class \"many\" other - match any number in the other or default class A number class defines a set of numbers that receive a particular syntax in the strings. For example, in Slovenian, integers ending in the digit \"1\" are in the \"one\" class, including 1, 21, 31, ... 101, 111, etc. Similarly, integers ending in the digit \"2\" are in the \"two\" class. Integers ending in the digits \"3\" or \"4\" are in the \"few\" class, and every other integer is handled by the default string. The definition of what numbers are included in a class is locale-dependent. They are defined in the data file plurals.json. If your string is in a different locale than the default for ilib, you should call the setLocale() method of the string instance before calling this method. Other Pattern Types If the argument index is a boolean, the string values \"true\" and \"false\" may appear as the choice patterns. If the argument index is of type string, then the choice patterns may contain regular expressions, or static strings as degenerate regexps. Multiple Indexes If you have 2 or more indexes to format into a string, you can pass them as an array. When you do that, the patterns to match should be a comma-separate list of patterns as per the rules above. Example string: var str = new IString(\"zero,zero#There are no objects on zero pages.|one,one#There is 1 object on 1 page.|other,one#There are {number} objects on 1 page.|#There are {number} objects on {pages} pages.\"); var num = 4, pages = 1; console.log(str.formatChoice([num, pages], { number: num, pages: pages })); Gives the output: \"There are 4 objects on 1 page.\" Note that when there is a single index, you would typically leave the pattern blank to indicate the default choice. When there are multiple indices, sometimes one of the patterns has to be the default case when the other is not. Rather than leaving one or more of the patterns blank with commas that look out-of-place in the middle of it, you can use the word \"other\" to indicate a match with the default or other choice. The above example shows the use of the \"other\" pattern. That said, you are allowed to leave the pattern blank if you so choose. In the example above, the pattern for the third string could easily have been written as \",one\" instead of \"other,one\" and the result will be the same. Parameters: Name Type Description argIndex * | Array.&lt;*&gt; The index into the choice array of the current parameter, or an array of indices params Object The hash of parameter values that replace the replacement variables in the string @param {boolean} useIntlPlural [optional] true if you are willing to use Intl.PluralRules object If it is omitted, the default value is true Inherited From: IString#formatChoice Throws: \"syntax error in choice format pattern: \" if there is a syntax error Returns: the formatted string Type string getLocale() Return the locale to use when processing choice formats. The locale affects how number classes are interpretted. In some cultures, the limit \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 2 to 9\" and in yet others, \"few\" maps to \"any integer that ends in the digits 3 or 4\". Inherited From: IString#getLocale Returns: localespec to use when processing choice formats with this string Type string includes() Same as String.includes(). Inherited From: IString#includes Returns: true if the search string is found anywhere with the given string, and false otherwise Type boolean indexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.indexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Inherited From: IString#indexOf Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number iterator() Return an iterator that will step through all of the characters in the string one at a time and return their code points, taking care to step through the surrogate pairs in UTF-16 encoding properly. The standard Javascript String's charCodeAt() method only returns information about a particular 16-bit character in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. If the index is pointing to a low- or high-surrogate character, it will return a code point of the surrogate character rather than the code point of the character in the supplementary planes that the two surrogates together encode. The iterator instance returned has two methods, hasNext() which returns true if the iterator has more code points to iterate through, and next() which returns the next code point as a number. Inherited From: IString#iterator Returns: an iterator that iterates through all the code points in the string Type Object lastIndexOf(searchValue, start) Same as String.lastIndexOf() Parameters: Name Type Description searchValue string string to search for start number index into the string to start searching, or undefined to search the entire string Inherited From: IString#lastIndexOf Returns: index into the string of the string being sought, or -1 if the string is not found Type number match(regexp) Same as String.match() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Inherited From: IString#match Returns: an array of matches Type Array.&lt;string&gt; matchAll(regexp) Same as String.matchAll() Parameters: Name Type Description regexp string the regular expression to match Inherited From: IString#matchAll Returns: an iterator of the matches Type iterator normalize(form) Perform the Unicode Normalization Algorithm upon the string and return the resulting new string. The current string is not modified. Forms The forms of possible normalizations are defined by the Unicode Standard Annex (UAX) 15. The form parameter is a string that may have one of the following values: nfd - Canonical decomposition. This decomposes characters into their exactly equivalent forms. For example, \"ü\" would decompose into a \"u\" followed by the combining diaeresis character. nfc - Canonical decomposition followed by canonical composition. This decomposes and then recomposes character into their shortest exactly equivalent forms by recomposing as many combining characters as possible. For example, \"ü\" followed by a combining macron character would decompose into a \"u\" followed by the combining macron characters the combining diaeresis character, and then be recomposed into the u with macron and diaeresis \"ṻ\" character. The reason that the \"nfc\" form decomposes and then recomposes is that combining characters have a specific order under the Unicode Normalization Algorithm, and partly composed characters such as the \"ü\" followed by combining marks may change the order of the combining marks when decomposed and recomposed. nfkd - Compatibility decomposition. This decomposes characters into compatible forms that may not be exactly equivalent semantically, as well as performing canonical decomposition as well. For example, the \"œ\" ligature character decomposes to the two characters \"oe\" because they are compatible even though they are not exactly the same semantically. nfkc - Compatibility decomposition followed by canonical composition. This decomposes characters into compatible forms, then recomposes characters using the canonical composition. That is, it breaks down characters into the compatible forms, and then recombines all combining marks it can with their base characters. For example, the character \"ǽ\" would be normalized to \"aé\" by first decomposing the character into \"a\" followed by \"e\" followed by the combining acute accent combining mark, and then recomposed to an \"a\" followed by the \"e\" with acute accent. Operation Two strings a and b can be said to be canonically equivalent if normalize(a) = normalize(b) under the nfc normalization form. Two strings can be said to be compatible if normalize(a) = normalize(b) under the nfkc normalization form. The canonical normalization is often used to see if strings are equivalent to each other, and thus is useful when implementing parsing algorithms or exact matching algorithms. It can also be used to ensure that any string output produces a predictable sequence of characters. Compatibility normalization does not always preserve the semantic meaning of all the characters, although this is sometimes the behaviour that you are after. It is useful, for example, when doing searches of user-input against text in documents where the matches are supposed to \"fuzzy\". In this case, both the query string and the document string would be mapped to their compatibility normalized forms, and then compared. Compatibility normalization also does not guarantee round-trip conversion to and from legacy character sets as the normalization is \"lossy\". It is akin to doing a lower- or upper-case conversion on text -- after casing, you cannot tell what case each character is in the original string. It is good for matching and searching, but it rarely good for output because some distinctions or meanings in the original text have been lost. Note that W3C normalization for HTML also escapes and unescapes HTML character entities such as \"&amp;uuml;\" for u with diaeresis. This method does not do such escaping or unescaping. If normalization is required for HTML strings with entities, unescaping should be performed on the string prior to calling this method. Data Normalization requires a fair amount of mapping data, much of which you may not need for the characters expected in your texts. It is possible to assemble a copy of ilib that saves space by only including normalization data for those scripts that you expect to encounter in your data. The normalization data is organized by normalization form and within there by script. To include the normalization data for a particular script with a particular normalization form, use the following require: NormString.init({ form: \"&lt;form&gt;\", script: \"&lt;script&gt;\" }); Where &lt;form&amp;gt is the normalization form (\"nfd\", \"nfc\", \"nfkd\", or \"nfkc\"), and &lt;script&gt; is the ISO 15924 code for the script you would like to support. Example: to load in the NFC data for Cyrillic, you would use: NormString.init({ form: \"nfc\", script: \"Cyrl\" }); Note that because certain normalization forms include others in their algorithm, their data also depends on the data for the other forms. For example, if you include the \"nfc\" data for a script, you will automatically get the \"nfd\" data for that same script as well because the NFC algorithm does NFD normalization first. Here are the dependencies: NFD -&gt; no dependencies NFC -&gt; NFD NFKD -&gt; NFD NFKC -&gt; NFKD, NFD, NFC A special value for the script dependency is \"all\" which will cause the data for all scripts to be loaded for that normalization form. This would be useful if you know that you are going to normalize a lot of multilingual text or cannot predict which scripts will appear in the input. Because the NFKC form depends on all others, you can get all of the data for all forms automatically by depending on \"nfkc/all.js\". Note that the normalization data for practically all script automatically depend on data for the Common script (code \"Zyyy\") which contains all of the characters that are commonly used in many different scripts. Examples of characters in the Common script are the ASCII punctuation characters, or the ASCII Arabic numerals \"0\" through \"9\". By default, none of the data for normalization is automatically included in the preassembled ilib files. (For size \"full\".) If you would like to normalize strings, you must assemble your own copy of ilib and explicitly include the normalization data for those scripts. This normalization method will produce output, even without the normalization data. However, the output will be simply the same thing as its input for all scripts except Korean Hangul and Jamo, which are decomposed and recomposed algorithmically and therefore do not rely on data. If characters are encountered for which there are no normalization data, they will be passed through to the output string unmodified.

Locales differ in the way that digits in a formatted number are grouped, in the way the decimal character is represented, etc. Use this formatter to get it right for any locale. This formatter can format plain numbers, currency amounts, and percentage amounts. As with all formatters, the recommended practice is to create one formatter and use it multiple times to format various numbers. The options can contain any of the following properties: locale - use the conventions of the specified locale when figuring out how to format a number. type - the type of this formatter. Valid values are \"number\", \"currency\", or \"percentage\". If this property is not specified, the default is \"number\". currency - the ISO 4217 3-letter currency code to use when the formatter type is \"currency\". This property is required for currency formatting. If the type property is \"currency\" and the currency property is not specified, the constructor will throw a an exception. maxFractionDigits - the maximum number of digits that should appear in the formatted output after the decimal. A value of -1 means unlimited, and 0 means only print the integral part of the number. minFractionDigits - the minimum number of fractional digits that should appear in the formatted output. If the number does not have enough fractional digits to reach this minimum, the number will be zero-padded at the end to get to the limit. If the type of the formatter is \"currency\" and this property is not specified, then the minimum fraction digits is set to the normal number of digits used with that currency, which is almost always 0, 2, or 3 digits. significantDigits - specify that max number of significant digits in the formatted output. This applies before and after the decimal point. The amount is rounded according to the rounding mode specified, or the rounding mode as given in the locale information. If the significant digits and the max or min fraction digits are both specified, this formatter will attempt to honour them both by choosing the one that is smaller if there is a conflict. For example, if the max fraction digits is 6 and the significant digits is 5 and the number to be formatted has a long fraction, it will only format 5 digits. The default is \"unlimited digits\", which means to format as many digits as the javascript engine can represent internally (usually around 13-15 or so on a 64-bit machine). useNative - the flag used to determaine whether to use the native script settings for formatting the numbers . roundingMode - When the maxFractionDigits or maxIntegerDigits is specified, this property governs how the least significant digits are rounded to conform to that maximum. The value of this property is a string with one of the following values: up - round away from zero down - round towards zero. This has the effect of truncating the number ceiling - round towards positive infinity floor - round towards negative infinity halfup - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round up. halfdown - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round down. halfeven - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round towards the even neighbour halfodd - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round towards the odd neighbour When the type of the formatter is \"currency\" and the roundingMode property is not set, then the standard legal rounding rules for the locale are followed. If the type is \"number\" or \"percentage\" and the roundingMode property is not set, then the default mode is \"halfdown\".. style - When the type of this formatter is \"currency\", the currency amount can be formatted in the following styles: \"common\" and \"iso\". The common style is the one commonly used in every day writing where the currency unit is represented using a symbol. eg. \"$57.35\" for fifty-seven dollars and thirty five cents. The iso style is the international style where the currency unit is represented using the ISO 4217 code. eg. \"USD 57.35\" for the same amount. The default is \"common\" style if the style is not specified. When the type of this formatter is \"number\", the style can be one of the following: standard - format a fully specified floating point number properly for the locale scientific - use scientific notation for all numbers. That is, 1 integral digit, followed by a number of fractional digits, followed by an \"e\" which denotes exponentiation, followed digits which give the power of 10 in the exponent. native - format a floating point number using the native digits and formatting symbols for the script of the locale. nogrouping - format a floating point number without grouping digits for the integral portion of the number Note that if you specify a maximum number of integral digits, the formatter with a standard style will give you standard formatting for smaller numbers and scientific notation for larger numbers. The default is standard style if this is not specified. onLoad - a callback function to call when the format data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new NumFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object.&lt;string, *&gt; A set of options that govern how the formatter will behave Methods constrain(num) Apply the constraints used in the current formatter to the given number. This will will apply the maxFractionDigits, significantDigits, and rounding mode constraints and return the result. The result is further manipulated in the format method to produce the final formatted number string. This method is intended for use by code that needs to use the same number that this formatter instance uses for formatting before that number is turned into a formatted string. Parameters: Name Type Description num number the number to constrain Returns: the number with the constraints applied to it Type number format(num) Format a number according to the settings of this number formatter instance. Parameters: Name Type Description num number | string | INumber | Number a floating point number to format Returns: a string containing the formatted number Type string getCurrency() Returns the ISO 4217 code for the currency that this formatter formats. IF the typeof this formatter is not \"currency\", then this method will return undefined. Returns: the ISO 4217 code for the currency that this formatter formats, or undefined if this not a currency formatter Type string getLocale() Return the locale for this formatter instance. Returns: the locale instance for this formatter Type Locale getMaxFractionDigits() Returns the maximum fraction digits set up in the constructor. Returns: the maximum number of fractional digits this formatter will format, or -1 for no maximum Type number getMinFractionDigits() Returns the minimum fraction digits set up in the constructor. If the formatter has the type \"currency\", then the minimum fraction digits is the amount of digits that is standard for the currency in question unless overridden in the options to the constructor. Returns: the minimum number of fractional digits this formatter will format, or -1 for no minimum Type number getRoundingMode() Returns the rounding mode set up in the constructor. The rounding mode controls how numbers are rounded when the integral or fraction digits of a number are limited. Returns: the name of the rounding mode used in this formatter Type string getSignificantDigits() Returns the significant digits set up in the constructor. Returns: the number of significant digits this formatter will format, or -1 for no minimum Type number getStyle() If this formatter is a currency formatter, then the style determines how the currency is denoted in the formatted output. This method returns the style that this formatter will produce. (See the constructor comment for more about the styles.) Returns: the name of the style this formatter will use to format currency amounts, or \"undefined\" if this formatter is not a currency formatter Type string getType() Return the type of formatter. Valid values are \"number\", \"currency\", and \"percentage\". Returns: the type of formatter Type string getUseNative() Return true if this formatter uses native digits to format the number. If the useNative option is given to the constructor, then this flag will be honoured. If the useNative option is not given to the constructor, this this formatter will use native digits if the locale typically uses native digits. Returns: true if this formatter will format with native digits, false otherwise Type boolean isGroupingUsed() Returns true if this formatter groups together digits in the integral portion of a number, based on the options set up in the constructor. In most western European cultures, this means separating every 3 digits of the integral portion of a number with a particular character. Returns: true if this formatter groups digits in the integral portion of the number Type boolean &lt;static&gt; getAvailableLocales() Return an array of available locales that this formatter can format Returns: an array of available locales Type Array.&lt;Locale&gt; | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

The constructor parameters can contain any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970, Gregorian julianday - sets the time of this instance according to the given Julian Day instance or the Julian Day given as a float year - any integer, including 0 month - 1 to 12, where 1 means Farvardin, 2 means Ordibehesht, etc. day - 1 to 31 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 timezone - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this persian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. locale - locale for this persian date. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If the constructor is called with another Persian date instance instead of a parameter block, the other instance acts as a parameter block and its settings are copied into the current instance. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). If any of the properties from year through millisecond are not specified in the params, it is assumed that they have the smallest possible value in the range for the property (zero or one). new PersianAlgoDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Persian date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month.

Type: number Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcYear(rd) Return the year for the given RD Parameters: Name Type Description rd number RD to calculate from Returns: the year for the RD Type number after(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new date instance in the current calendar that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Returns: the day of the week Type number getDayOfYear() Return the ordinal day of the year. Days are counted from 1 and proceed linearly up to 365, regardless of months or weeks, etc. That is, Farvardin 1st is day 1, and December 31st is 365 in regular years, or 366 in leap years. Returns: the ordinal day of the year Type number getEra() Return the era for this date as a number. The value for the era for Persian calendars is -1 for \"before the persian era\" (BP) and 1 for \"the persian era\" (anno persico or AP). BP dates are any date before Farvardin 1, 1 AP. In the proleptic Persian calendar, there is a year 0, so any years that are negative or zero are BP. Returns: 1 if this date is in the common era, -1 if it is before the common era Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Inherited From: IDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number &lt;protected&gt; newRd( [params]) Return a new RD for this date type using the given params. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; the parameters used to create this rata die instance Returns: the new RD instance for the given params Type RataDie onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Inherited From: IDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day.

This class encodes information about a Persian calendar. This class differs from the Persian calendar in that the leap years are calculated based on the astronomical observations of the sun in Teheran, instead of calculating the leap years based on a regular cyclical rhythm algorithm. new PersianCal( [options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;optional&gt; Options governing the construction of this instance Extends Calendar Methods getMonLength(month, year) Return the number of days in a particular month in a particular year. This function can return a different number for a month depending on the year because of things like leap years. Parameters: Name Type Description month number the month for which the length is sought year number the year within which that month can be found Overrides: Calendar#getMonLength Returns: the number of days within the given month in the given year Type number getNumMonths(year) Return the number of months in the given year. The number of months in a year varies for some luni-solar calendars because in some years, an extra month is needed to extend the days in a year to an entire solar year. The month is represented as a 1-based number where 1=first month, 2=second month, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description year number a year for which the number of months is sought Overrides: Calendar#getNumMonths Returns: The number of months in the given year Type number getType() Return the type of this calendar.

The constructor parameters can contain any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970, Gregorian julianday - sets the time of this instance according to the given Julian Day instance or the Julian Day given as a float year - any integer, including 0 month - 1 to 12, where 1 means Farvardin, 2 means Ordibehesht, etc. day - 1 to 31 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 timezone - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this persian date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. locale - locale for this persian date. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. date - use the given intrinsic Javascript date to initialize this one. If the constructor is called with another Persian date instance instead of a parameter block, the other instance acts as a parameter block and its settings are copied into the current instance. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). If any of the properties from year through millisecond are not specified in the params, it is assumed that they have the smallest possible value in the range for the property (zero or one). new PersianDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Persian date Extends IDate Members day :number The day of the month.

The options object can contain zero or more of the following parameters: locale locale to use to format this number, or undefined to use the default locale style the name of style to use to format numbers, or undefined to use the default style mcc the MCC of the country to use if the number is a local number and the country code is not known onLoad - a callback function to call when the locale data is fully loaded and the address has been parsed. When the onLoad option is given, the address formatter object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Some regions have more than one style of formatting, and the style parameter selects which style the user prefers. An array of style names that this locale supports can be found by calling PhoneFmt.getAvailableStyles. Example phone numbers can be retrieved for each style by calling PhoneFmt.getStyleExample. If the MCC is given, numbers will be formatted in the manner of the country specified by the MCC. If it is not given, but the locale is, the manner of the country in the locale will be used. If neither the locale or MCC are not given, then the country of the current ilib locale is used. new PhoneFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object properties that control how this formatter behaves Members locale :PhoneLocale Type: PhoneLocale Methods _doFormat(number, options, startField) Do the actual work of formatting the phone number starting at the given field in the regular field order.

Returns: Type Object | Object.&lt;string, string&gt; &lt;protected&gt; _substituteDigits(part, formats, mustUseAll) Parameters: Name Type Description part string formats Object mustUseAll boolean format(number, options) Format the parts of a phone number appropriately according to the settings in this formatter instance. The options can contain zero or more of these properties: partial boolean which tells whether or not this phone number represents a partial number or not. The default is false, which means the number represents a whole number. style style to use to format the number, if different from the default style or the style specified in the constructor locale The locale with which to parse the number. This gives a clue as to which numbering plan to use. mcc The mobile carrier code (MCC) associated with the carrier that the phone is currently connected to, if known. This also can give a clue as to which numbering plan to use onLoad - a callback function to call when the date format object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the DateFmt object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. The partial parameter specifies whether or not the phone number contains a partial phone number or if it is a whole phone number. A partial number is usually a number as the user is entering it with a dial pad. The reason is that certain types of phone numbers should be formatted differently depending on whether or not it represents a whole number. Specifically, SMS short codes are formatted differently. Example: a subscriber number of \"48773\" in the US would get formatted as: partial: 487-73 (perhaps the user is in the process of typing a whole phone number such as 487-7379) whole: 48773 (this is the entire SMS short code) Any place in the UI where the user types in phone numbers, such as the keypad in the phone app, should pass in partial: true to this formatting routine. All other places, such as the call log in the phone app, should pass in partial: false, or leave the partial flag out of the parameters entirely. Parameters: Name Type Description number PhoneNumber object containing the phone number to format options Object Parameters which control how to format the number Returns: Returns the formatted phone number as a string.

The location of the number is calculated according to the following rules: If the areaCode property is undefined or empty, or if the number specifies a country code for which we do not have information, then the area property may be missing from the returned object. In this case, only the country object will be returned. If there is no area code, but there is a mobile prefix, service code, or emergency code, then a fixed string indicating the type of number will be returned. The country object is filled out according to the countryCode property of the phone number. If the phone number does not have an explicit country code, the MCC will be used if it is available. The country code can be gleaned directly from the MCC. If the MCC of the carrier to which the phone is currently connected is available, it should be passed in so that local phone numbers will look correct. If the country's dialling plan mandates a fixed length for phone numbers, and a particular number exceeds that length, then the area code will not be given on the assumption that the number has problems in the first place and we cannot guess correctly. The returned area property varies in specificity according to the locale. In North America, the area is no finer than large parts of states or provinces. In Germany and the UK, the area can be as fine as small towns. If the number passed in is invalid, no geolocation will be performed. If the location information about the country where the phone number is located is not available, then the area information will be missing and only the country will be available. The options parameter can contain any one of the following properties: locale The locale parameter is used to load translations of the names of regions and areas if available. For example, if the locale property is given as \"en-US\" (English for USA), but the phone number being geolocated is in Germany, then this class would return the the names of the country (Germany) and region inside of Germany in English instead of German. That is, a phone number in Munich and return the country \"Germany\" and the area code \"Munich\" instead of \"Deutschland\" and \"München\". The default display locale is the current ilib locale. If translations are not available, the region and area names are given in English, which should always be available. mcc The mcc of the current mobile carrier, if known. onLoad - a callback function to call when the data for the locale is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. new PhoneGeoLocator(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object parameters controlling the geolocation of the phone number. Methods country(number) Returns a string that describes the ISO-3166-2 country code of the given phone number. If the phone number is a local phone number and does not contain any country information, this routine will return the region for the current formatter instance. Parameters: Name Type Description number PhoneNumber An PhoneNumber instance Returns: Type string locate(number, options) Returns a the location of the given phone number, if known. The returned object has 2 properties, each of which has an sn (short name) and an ln (long name) string. Additionally, the country code, if given, includes the 2 letter ISO code for the recognized country. { \"country\": { \"sn\": \"North America\", \"ln\": \"North America and the Caribbean Islands\", \"code\": \"us\" }, \"area\": { \"sn\": \"California\", \"ln\": \"Central California: San Jose, Los Gatos, Milpitas, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Gilroy\" } } The location name is subject to the following rules: If the areaCode property is undefined or empty, or if the number specifies a country code for which we do not have information, then the area property may be missing from the returned object. In this case, only the country object will be returned. If there is no area code, but there is a mobile prefix, service code, or emergency code, then a fixed string indicating the type of number will be returned. The country object is filled out according to the countryCode property of the phone number. If the phone number does not have an explicit country code, the MCC will be used if it is available. The country code can be gleaned directly from the MCC. If the MCC of the carrier to which the phone is currently connected is available, it should be passed in so that local phone numbers will look correct. If the country's dialling plan mandates a fixed length for phone numbers, and a particular number exceeds that length, then the area code will not be given on the assumption that the number has problems in the first place and we cannot guess correctly. The returned area property varies in specificity according to the locale. In North America, the area is no finer than large parts of states or provinces. In Germany and the UK, the area can be as fine as small towns. The strings returned from this function are already localized to the given locale, and thus are ready for display to the user. If the number passed in is invalid, an empty object is returned. If the location information about the country where the phone number is located is not available, then the area information will be missing and only the country will be returned. The options parameter can contain any one of the following properties: locale The locale parameter is used to load translations of the names of regions and areas if available. For example, if the locale property is given as \"en-US\" (English for USA), but the phone number being geolocated is in Germany, then this class would return the the names of the country (Germany) and region inside of Germany in English instead of German. That is, a phone number in Munich and return the country \"Germany\" and the area code \"Munich\" instead of \"Deutschland\" and \"München\". The default display locale is the current ilib locale. If translations are not available, the region and area names are given in English, which should always be available. mcc The mcc of the current mobile carrier, if known. onLoad - a callback function to call when the data for the locale is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Parameters: Name Type Description number PhoneNumber phone number to locate options Object options governing the way this ares is loaded Returns: an object that describes the country and the area in that country corresponding to this phone number. Each of the country and area contain a short name (sn) and long name (ln) that describes the location.

The options object may include any of these properties: locale The locale with which to parse the number. This gives a clue as to which numbering plan to use. mcc The mobile carrier code (MCC) associated with the carrier that the phone is currently connected to, if known. This also can give a clue as to which numbering plan to use onLoad - a callback function to call when this instance is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. This function is locale-sensitive, and will assume any number passed to it is appropriate for the given locale. If the MCC is given, this method will assume that numbers without an explicit country code have been dialled within the country given by the MCC. This affects how things like area codes are parsed. If the MCC is not given, this method will use the given locale to determine the country code. If the locale is not explicitly given either, then this function uses the region of current locale as the default. The input number may contain any formatting characters for the given locale. Each field that is returned in the json object is a simple string of digits with all formatting and whitespace characters removed. The number is decomposed into its parts, regardless if the number contains formatting characters. If a particular part cannot be extracted from given number, the field will not be returned as a field in the object. If no fields can be extracted from the number at all, then all digits found in the string will be returned in the subscriberNumber field. If the number parameter contains no digits, an empty object is returned. This instance can contain any of the following fields after parsing is done: vsc - if this number starts with a VSC (Vertical Service Code, or \"star code\"), this field will contain the star and the code together iddPrefix - the prefix for international direct dialing. This can either be in the form of a plus character or the IDD access code for the given locale countryCode - if this number is an international direct dial number, this is the country code cic - for \"dial-around\" services (access to other carriers), this is the prefix used as the carrier identification code emergency - an emergency services number mobilePrefix - prefix that introduces a mobile phone number trunkAccess - trunk access code (long-distance access) serviceCode - like a geographic area code, but it is a required prefix for various services areaCode - geographic area codes subscriberNumber - the unique number of the person or company that pays for this phone line extension - in some countries, extensions are dialed directly without going through an operator or a voice prompt system. If the number includes an extension, it is given in this field. invalid - this property is added and set to true if the parser found that the number is invalid in the numbering plan for the country. This method will make its best effort at parsing, but any digits after the error will go into the subscriberNumber field The following rules determine how the number is parsed: If the number starts with a character that is alphabetic instead of numeric, do not parse the number at all. There is a good chance that it is not really a phone number. In this case, an empty instance will be returned. If the phone number uses the plus notation or explicitly uses the international direct dialing prefix for the given locale, then the country code is identified in the number. The rules of given locale are used to parse the IDD prefix, and then the rules of the country in the prefix are used to parse the rest of the number. If a country code is provided as an argument to the function call, use that country's parsing rules for the number. This is intended for programs like a Contacts application that know what the country is of the person that owns the phone number and can pass that on as a hint. If the appropriate locale cannot be easily determined, default to using the rules for the current user's region. Example: parsing the number \"+49 02101345345-78\" will give the following properties in the resulting phone number instance: { iddPrefix: \"+\", countryCode: \"49\", areaCode: \"02101\", subscriberNumber: \"345345\", extension: \"78\" } Note that in this example, because international direct dialing is explicitly used in the number, the part of this number after the IDD prefix and country code will be parsed exactly the same way in all locales with German rules (country code 49). Regions currently supported are: NANP (North American Numbering Plan) countries - USA, Canada, Bermuda, various Caribbean nations UK Republic of Ireland Germany France Spain Italy Mexico India People's Republic of China Netherlands Belgium Luxembourg Australia New Zealand Singapore Korea Japan Russia Brazil new PhoneNumber(number [, options]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description number string | PhoneNumber A free-form phone number to be parsed, or another phone number instance to copy options Object &lt;optional&gt; options that guide the parser in parsing the number Members areaCode :string|undefined The area code prefix of a land line number.

This is always followed by the country code. Type: string mobilePrefix :string|undefined The prefix of the subscriber number that indicates that this is the number of a mobile phone.

These are codes that typically start with a star or hash, like \"*69\" for \"dial back the last number that called me\". Type: string | undefined Methods &lt;protected&gt; _getPrefix() &lt;protected&gt; _hasPrefix() &lt;protected&gt; _join() return a version of the phone number that contains only the dialable digits in the correct order &lt;protected&gt; _parseNumber(number, regionData, options) Parameters: Name Type Description number string regionData Object options Object &lt;protected&gt; _parseOtherCountry(number, regionData, options, countryCode) Parameters: Name Type Description number string regionData Object options Object countryCode string &lt;protected&gt; _xor() Exclusive or -- return true, if one is defined and the other isn't compare(other) This routine will compare the two phone numbers in an locale-sensitive manner to see if they possibly reference the same phone number. In many places, there are multiple ways to reach the same phone number. In North America for example, you might have a number with the trunk access code of \"1\" and another without, and they reference the exact same phone number. This is considered a strong match. For a different pair of numbers, one may be a local number and the other a full phone number with area code, which may reference the same phone number if the local number happens to be located in that area code. However, you cannot say for sure if it is in that area code, so it will be considered a somewhat weaker match. Similarly, in other countries, there are sometimes different ways of reaching the same destination, and the way that numbers match depends on the locale. The various phone number fields are handled differently for matches. There are various fields that do not need to match at all. For example, you may type equally enter \"00\" or \"+\" into your phone to start international direct dialling, so the iddPrefix field does not need to match at all. Typically, fields that require matches need to match exactly if both sides have a value for that field. If both sides specify a value and those values differ, that is a strong non-match. If one side does not have a value and the other does, that causes a partial match, because the number with the missing field may possibly have an implied value that matches the other number. For example, the numbers \"650-555-1234\" and \"555-1234\" have a partial match as the local number \"555-1234\" might possibly have the same 650 area code as the first number, and might possibly not. If both side do not specify a value for a particular field, that field is considered matching. The values of following fields are ignored when performing matches: vsc iddPrefix cic trunkAccess The values of the following fields matter if they do not match: countryCode - A difference causes a moderately strong problem except for certain countries where there is a way to access the same subscriber via IDD and via intranetwork dialling mobilePrefix - A difference causes a possible non-match serviceCode - A difference causes a possible non-match areaCode - A difference causes a possible non-match subscriberNumber - A difference causes a very strong non-match extension - A difference causes a minor non-match Parameters: Name Type Description other string | PhoneNumber other phone number to compare this one to Returns: non-negative integer describing the percentage quality of the match. 100 means a very strong match (100%), and lower numbers are less and less strong, down to 0 meaning not at all a match. Type number equals(other) Determine whether or not the other phone number is exactly equal to the current one. The difference between the compare method and the equals method is that the compare method compares normalized numbers with each other and returns the degree of match, whereas the equals operator returns true iff the two numbers contain the same fields and the fields are exactly the same. Functions and other non-phone number properties are not compared. Parameters: Name Type Description other string | PhoneNumber another phone number to compare to this one Returns: true if the numbers are the same, false otherwise Type boolean normalize(options) This function normalizes the current phone number to a canonical format and returns a string with that phone number. If parts are missing, this function attempts to fill in those parts. The options object contains a set of properties that can possibly help normalize this number by providing \"extra\" information to the algorithm. The options parameter may be null or an empty object if no hints can be determined before this call is made. If any particular hint is not available, it does not need to be present in the options object. The following is a list of hints that the algorithm will look for in the options object: mcc the mobile carrier code of the current network upon which this phone is operating. This is translated into an IDD country code. This is useful if the number being normalized comes from CNAP (callerid) and the MCC is known. defaultAreaCode the area code of the phone number of the current device, if available. Local numbers in a person's contact list are most probably in this same area code. country the 2 letter ISO 3166 code of the country if it is known from some other means such as parsing the physical address of the person associated with the phone number, or the from the domain name of the person's email address networkType specifies whether the phone is currently connected to a CDMA network or a UMTS network. Valid values are the strings \"cdma\" and \"umts\". If one of those two strings are not specified, or if this property is left off completely, this method will assume UMTS. The following are a list of options that control the behaviour of the normalization: assistedDialing if this is set to true, the number will be normalized so that it can dialled directly on the type of network this phone is currently connected to. This allows customers to dial numbers or use numbers in their contact list that are specific to their \"home\" region when they are roaming and those numbers would not otherwise work with the current roaming carrier as they are. The home region is specified as the phoneRegion system preference that is settable in the regional settings app. With assisted dialling, this method will add or remove international direct dialling prefixes and country codes, as well as national trunk access codes, as required by the current roaming carrier and the home region in order to dial the number properly. If it is not possible to construct a full international dialling sequence from the options and hints given, this function will not modify the phone number, and will return \"undefined\". If assisted dialling is false or not specified, then this method will attempt to add all the information it can to the number so that it is as fully specified as possible. This allows two numbers to be compared more easily when those two numbers were otherwise only partially specified. sms set this option to true for the following conditions: assisted dialing is turned on the phone number represents the destination of an SMS message the phone is UMTS the phone is SIM-locked to its carrier This enables special international direct dialling codes to route the SMS message to the correct carrier. If assisted dialling is not turned on, this option has no affect. manualDialing set this option to true if the user is entering this number on the keypad directly, and false when the number comes from a stored location like a contact entry or a call log entry. When true, this option causes the normalizer to not perform any normalization on numbers that look like local numbers in the home country. If false, all numbers go through normalization. This option only has an effect when the assistedDialing option is true as well, otherwise it is ignored. If both a set of options and a locale are given, and they offer conflicting information, the options will take precedence. The idea is that the locale tells you the region setting that the user has chosen (probably in firstuse), whereas the the hints are more current information such as where the phone is currently operating (the MCC). This function performs the following types of normalizations with assisted dialling turned on: If the current location of the phone matches the home country, this is a domestic call. Remove any iddPrefix and countryCode fields, as they are not needed Add in a trunkAccess field that may be necessary to call a domestic numbers in the home country If the current location of the phone does not match the home country, attempt to form a whole international number. Add in the area code if it is missing from the phone number and the area code of the current phone is available in the hints Add the country dialling code for the home country if it is missing from the phone number Add or replace the iddPrefix with the correct one for the current country. The phone number will have been parsed with the settings for the home country, so the iddPrefix may be incorrect for the current country. The iddPrefix for the current country can be \"+\" if the phone is connected to a UMTS network, and either a \"+\" or a country-dependent sequences of digits for CDMA networks. This function performs the following types of normalization with assisted dialling turned off: Normalize the international direct dialing prefix to be a plus or the international direct dialling access code for the current country, depending on the network type. If a number is a local number (ie. it is missing its area code), use a default area code from the hints if available. CDMA phones always know their area code, and GSM/UMTS phones know their area code in many instances, but not always (ie. not on Vodaphone or Telcel phones). If the default area code is not available, do not add it. In assisted dialling mode, if a number is missing its country code, use the current MCC number if it is available to figure out the current country code, and prepend that to the number. If it is not available, leave it off. Also, use that country's settings to parse the number instead of the current format locale. For North American numbers with an area code but no trunk access code, add in the trunk access code. For other countries, if the country code is added in step 3, remove the trunk access code when required by that country's conventions for international calls. If the country requires a trunk access code for international calls and it doesn't exist, add one. This method modifies the current object, and also returns a string containing the normalized phone number that can be compared directly against other normalized numbers. The canonical format for phone numbers that is returned from thhomeLocaleis method is simply an uninterrupted and unformatted string of dialable digits. Parameters: Name Type Description options Object an object containing options to help in normalizing. Returns: the normalized string, or undefined if the number could not be normalized Type string | undefined &lt;protected, static&gt; _getCharacterCode() &lt;protected, static&gt; _parseImsi() &lt;static&gt; parseImsi(imsi, options) Parse an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number into its 3 constituent parts: mcc - Mobile Country Code, which identifies the country where the phone is currently receiving service. mnc - Mobile Network Code, which identifies the carrier which is currently providing service to the phone msin - Mobile Subscription Identifier Number. This is a unique number identifying the mobile phone on the network, which usually maps to an account/subscriber in the carrier's database. Because this function may need to load data to identify the above parts, you can pass an options object that controls how the data is loaded. The options may contain any of the following properties: onLoad - a callback function to call when the parsing is done. When the onLoad option is given, this method will attempt to load the locale data using the ilib loader callback. When it is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the parsing results as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic, synchronous or asynchronous loading or a mix of the above. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the results returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Parameters: Name Type Description imsi string IMSI number to parse options Object options controlling the loading of the locale data Returns: components of the IMSI number, when the locale data is loaded synchronously, or undefined if asynchronous Type Object | undefined × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template.

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description to string the name of the units to convert this measurement to Inherited From: Measurement#convert Returns: the amount corresponding to the requested unit Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;optional&gt; object containing a mapping between the measurement system and an array of units to use to restrict the expansion to constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#expand Returns: an array of new measurements in order from the current units to the smallest units in the system which together are the same measurement as this one Type Array.&lt;Measurement&gt; getAmount() Return the numeric amount of this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type.

Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description to string the name of the units to convert this measurement to Inherited From: Measurement#convert Returns: the amount corresponding to the requested unit Type number | undefined convertSystem(measurementSystem) Return a new measurement instance that is converted to a different measurement system. Measurements can only be converted to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure units Array.&lt;string&gt; &lt;optional&gt; object containing a mapping between the measurement system and an array of units to use to restrict the expansion to constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#expand Returns: an array of new measurements in order from the current units to the smallest units in the system which together are the same measurement as this one Type Array.&lt;Measurement&gt; getAmount() Return the numeric amount of this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getAmount Returns: the numeric amount of this measurement Type number getMeasure() Return the type of this measurement. Examples are \"mass\", \"length\", \"speed\", etc. Measurements can only be converted to measurements of the same type. The type of the units is determined automatically from the units. For example, the unit \"grams\" is type \"mass\". Use the static call Measurement.getAvailableUnits to find out what units this version of ilib supports. Overrides: Measurement#getMeasure Returns: the name of the type of this measurement Type string getMeasurementSystem() Return the name of the measurement system that the current unit is a part of. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasurementSystem Returns: the name of the measurement system for the units of this measurement Type string getMeasures() Return an array of all units that this measurement types supports. Inherited From: Measurement#getMeasures Returns: an array of all units that this measurement types supports Type Array.&lt;string&gt; getOriginalUnit() Return the units originally used to construct this measurement before it was normalized. Inherited From: Measurement#getOriginalUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnit() Return the normalized units used in this measurement. Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Inherited From: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement newUnit(params) Return a new instance of this type of measurement. Parameters: Name Type Description params Object parameters to the constructor Returns: a measurement subclass instance Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified. Examples: \"metres\" gets normalized to \"meter\" \"ml\" gets normalized to \"milliliter\" \"foobar\" gets normalized to \"foobar\" (no change because it is not recognized) Parameters: Name Type Description name string name of the units to normalize. Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem] [, units]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; the name of the system to scale to units Object &lt;optional&gt; mapping from the measurement system to the units to use for this scaling.

The resource bundle loads strings appropriate for a particular locale and provides them via the getString method. The options object may contain any (or none) of the following properties: locale - The locale of the strings to load. If not specified, the default locale is the the default for the web page or app in which the bundle is being loaded. name - Base name of the resource bundle to load. If not specified the default base name is \"resources\". type - Name the type of strings this bundle contains. Valid values are \"xml\", \"html\", \"text\", \"c\", \"raw\", \"ruby\", or \"template\". The default is \"text\". If the type is \"xml\" or \"html\", then XML/HTML entities and tags are not pseudo-translated. During a real translation, HTML character entities are translated to their corresponding characters in a source string before looking that string up in the translations. Also, the characters \"\", and \"&amp;\" are converted to entities again in the output, but characters are left as they are. If the type is \"xml\", \"html\", \"ruby\", or \"text\" types, then the replacement parameter names are not pseudo-translated as well so that the output can be used for formatting with the IString class. If the type is \"c\" then all C language style printf replacement parameters (eg. \"%s\" and \"%d\") are skipped automatically. This includes iOS/Objective-C/Swift substitution parameters like \"%@\" or \"%1$@\". If the type is raw, all characters are pseudo-translated, including replacement parameters as well as XML/HTML tags and entities. lengthen - when pseudo-translating the string, tell whether or not to automatically lengthen the string to simulate \"long\" languages such as German or French. This is a boolean value. Default is false. missing - what to do when a resource is missing. The choices are: source - return the source string unchanged pseudo - return the pseudo-translated source string, translated to the script of the locale if the mapping is available, or just the default Latin pseudo-translation if not empty - return the empty string The default behaviour is the same as before, which is to return the source string unchanged. basePath - look in the given path for the resource bundle files. This can be an absolute path or a relative path that is relative to the application's root. Default if this is not specified is to look in the standard path (ie. in the root of the app). onLoad - a callback function to call when the resources are fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. The locale option may be given as a locale spec string or as an Locale object. If the locale option is not specified, then strings for the default locale will be loaded. The name option can be used to put groups of strings together in a single bundle. The strings will then appear together in a JS object in a JS file that can be included before the ilib. A resource bundle with a particular name is actually a set of bundles that are each specific to a language, a language plus a region, etc. All bundles with the same base name should contain the same set of source strings, but with different translations for the given locale. The user of the bundle does not need to be aware of the locale of the bundle, as long as it contains values for the strings it needs. Strings in bundles for a particular locale are inherited from parent bundles that are more generic. In general, the hierarchy is as follows (from least locale-specific to most locale-specific): language region language_script language_region region_variant language_script_region language_region_variant language_script_region_variant That is, if the translation for a string does not exist in the current locale, the more-generic parent locale is searched for the string. In the worst case scenario, the string is not found in the base locale's strings. In this case, the missing option guides this class on what to do. If the missing option is \"source\", then the original source is returned as the translation. If it is \"empty\", the empty string is returned. If it is \"pseudo\", then the pseudo-translated string that is appropriate for the default script of the locale is returned. This allows developers to create code with new or changed strings in it and check in that code without waiting for the translations to be done first. The translated version of the app or web site will still function properly, but will show a spurious untranslated string here and there until the translations are done and also checked in. The base is whatever language your developers use to code in. For a German web site, strings in the source code may be written in German for example. Often this base is English, as many web sites are coded in English, but that is not required. The strings can be extracted with the ilib localization tool (which will be shipped at some future time.) Once the strings have been translated, the set of translated files can be generated with the same tool. The output from the tool can be used as input to the ResBundle object. It is up to the web page or app to make sure the JS file that defines the bundle is included before creating the ResBundle instance. A special locale \"zxx-XX\" is used as the pseudo-translation locale because zxx means \"no linguistic information\" in the ISO 639 standard, and the region code XX is defined to be user-defined in the ISO 3166 standard. Pseudo-translation is a locale where the translations are generated on the fly based on the contents of the source string. Characters in the source string are replaced with other characters and returned. Example. If the source string is: \"This is a string\" then the pseudo-translated version might look something like this: \"Ţħïş ïş á şţřïñĝ\" Pseudo-translation can be used to test that your app or web site is translatable before an actual translation has happened. These bugs can then be fixed before the translation starts, avoiding an explosion of bugs later when each language's tester registers the same bug complaining that the same string is not translated. When pseudo-localizing with the Latin script, this allows the strings to be readable in the UI in the source language (if somewhat funky-looking), so that a tester can easily verify that the string is properly externalized and loaded from a resource bundle without the need to be able to read a foreign language. If one of a list of script tags is given in the pseudo-locale specifier, then the pseudo-localization can map characters to very rough transliterations of characters in the given script. For example, zxx-Hebr-XX maps strings to Hebrew characters, which can be used to test your UI in a right-to-left language to catch bidi bugs before a translation is done. Currently, the list of target scripts includes Hebrew (Hebr), Chinese Simplified Han (Hans), and Cyrillic (Cyrl) with more to be added later. If no script is explicitly specified in the locale spec, or if the script is not supported, then the default mapping maps Latin base characters to accented versions of those Latin characters as in the example above. When the \"lengthen\" property is set to true in the options, the pseudotranslation code will add digits to the end of the string to simulate the lengthening that occurs when translating to other languages. The above example will come out like this: \"Ţħïş ïş á şţřïñĝ76543210\" The string is lengthened according to the length of the source string. If the source string is less than 20 characters long, the string is lengthened by 50%. If the source string is 20-40 characters long, the string is lengthened by 33%. If te string is greater than 40 characters long, the string is lengthened by 20%. The pseudotranslation always ends a string with the digit \"0\". If you do not see the digit \"0\" in the UI for your app, you know that truncation has occurred, and the number you see at the end of the string tells you how many characters were truncated. new ResBundle(options) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description options Object &lt;nullable&gt; Options controlling how the bundle is created Methods &lt;protected&gt; _loadPseudo() containsKey( [source] [, key]) Return true if the current bundle contains a translation for the given key and source. The getString method will always return a string for any given key and source combination, so it cannot be used to tell if a translation exists. Either one or both of the source and key must be specified. If both are not specified, this method will return false. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description source string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; source string to look up key string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; key to look up Returns: true if this bundle contains a translation for the key, and false otherwise Type boolean getLocale() Return the locale of this resource bundle. Returns: the locale of this resource bundle object Type Locale getName() Return the name of this resource bundle. This corresponds to the name option given to the constructor. Returns: name of the the current instance Type string getResObj() Return the merged resources as an entire object. When loading resources for a locale that are not just a set of translated strings, but instead an entire structured javascript object, you can gain access to that object via this call. This method will ensure that all the of the parts of the object are correct for the locale. For pre-assembled data, it starts by loading ilib.data[name], where name is the base name for this set of resources. Then, it successively merges objects in the base data using progressively more locale-specific data. It loads it in this order from ilib.data: language region language_script language_region region_variant language_script_region language_region_variant language_script_region_variant For dynamically loaded data, the code attempts to load the same sequence as above, but with slash path separators instead of underscores. Loading the resources this way allows the program to share resources between all locales that share a common language, region, or script. As a general rule-of-thumb, resources should be as generic as possible in order to cover as many locales as possible. Returns: returns the object that is the basis for this resources instance Type Object getString(source, key [, escapeMode]) Return a localized string, array, or object. This method can localize individual strings or arrays of strings. If the source parameter is a string, the translation of that string is looked up and returned. If the source parameter is an array of strings, then the translation of each of the elements of that array is looked up, and an array of translated strings is returned. If any string is not found in the loaded set of resources, the original source string is returned. If the key is not given, then the source string itself is used as the key. In the case where the source string is used as the key, the whitespace is compressed down to 1 space each, and the whitespace at the beginning and end of the string is trimmed. The escape mode specifies what type of output you are escaping the returned string for. Modes are similar to the types: \"html\" -- prevents HTML injection by escaping the characters &lt; &gt; and &amp; \"xml\" -- currently same as \"html\" mode \"js\" -- prevents breaking Javascript syntax by backslash escaping all quote and double-quote characters \"attribute\" -- meant for HTML attribute values. Currently this is the same as \"js\" escape mode. \"default\" -- use the type parameter from the constructor as the escape mode as well \"none\" or undefined -- no escaping at all. The type parameter of the constructor specifies what type of strings this bundle is operating upon. This allows pseudo-translation and automatic key generation to happen properly by telling this class how to parse the string. The escape mode for this method is different in that it specifies how this string will be used in the calling code and therefore how to escape it properly. For example, a section of Javascript code may be constructing an HTML snippet in a string to add to the web page. In this case, the type parameter in the constructor should be \"html\" so that the source string can be parsed properly, but the escape mode should be \"js\" so that the output string can be used in Javascript without causing syntax errors. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description source string | Array.&lt;string&gt;= the source string or strings to translate key string | Array.&lt;string&gt;= optional name of the key, if any escapeMode string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; escape mode, if any Returns: the translation of the given source/key or undefined if the translation is not found and the source is undefined Type IString | Array.&lt;IString&gt; | undefined getStringJS(source, key [, escapeMode]) Return a localized string as an intrinsic Javascript String object. This does the same thing as the getString() method, but it returns a regular Javascript string instead of and IString instance. This means it cannot be formatted with the format() method without being wrapped in an IString instance first. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description source string | Array.&lt;string&gt;= the source string to translate key string | Array.&lt;string&gt;= optional name of the key, if any escapeMode string &lt;optional&gt; &lt;nullable&gt; escape mode, if any Returns: the translation of the given source/key or undefined if the translation is not found and the source is undefined Type string | Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined getType() Return the type of this resource bundle. This corresponds to the type option given to the constructor.

Default if this is not specified is the current locale. name - the name of the map to load mapFunction - specify an algorithmic mapping function to use if the mapper does not have an explicit mapping for a character. The idea is to save disk and memory when algorithmic mapping can be done for some of the characters, but not others. The exceptions can go into the json file, and the characters that conform to the rule can be mapped algorithmically. The map function should take a string containing 1 character as a parameter and should return a string containing one or more characters.

Parameters: Name Type Description measurementSystem string the name of the system to convert to Inherited From: Measurement#convertSystem Returns: a new measurement in the given system, or the current measurement if it is already in the given system or could not be converted Type Measurement expand( [measurementsystem] [, units], constrain [, scale]) Expand the current measurement such that any fractions of the current unit are represented in terms of smaller units in the same system instead of fractions of the current unit. For example, \"6.25 feet\" may be represented as \"6 feet 4 inches\" instead. The return value is an array of measurements which are progressively smaller until the smallest unit in the system is reached or until there is a whole number of any unit along the way.

Inherited From: Measurement#getUnit Returns: name of the unit of measurement Type string getUnitIdCaseInsensitive(unit) Return the normalized units identifier for the given unit, searching case-insensitively. This has the risk that things may match erroneously because many short form unit strings are case-sensitive. This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers.

The constructor parameters can contain any of the following properties: unixtime - sets the time of this instance according to the given unix time. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970. julianday - sets the time of this instance according to the given Julian Day instance or the Julian Day given as a float year - any integer, including 0 month - 1 to 12, where 1 means January, 2 means February, etc. day - 1 to 31 hour - 0 to 23. A formatter is used to display 12 hour clocks, but this representation is always done with an unambiguous 24 hour representation minute - 0 to 59 second - 0 to 59 millisecond - 0 to 999 timezone - the TimeZone instance or time zone name as a string of this Thai solar date. The date/time is kept in the local time. The time zone is used later if this date is formatted according to a different time zone and the difference has to be calculated, or when the date format has a time zone component in it. locale - locale for this Thai solar date. If the time zone is not given, it can be inferred from this locale. For locales that span multiple time zones, the one with the largest population is chosen as the one that represents the locale. If the constructor is called with another Thai solar date instance instead of a parameter block, the other instance acts as a parameter block and its settings are copied into the current instance. If the constructor is called with no arguments at all or if none of the properties listed above from unixtime through millisecond are present, then the date components are filled in with the current date at the time of instantiation. Note that if you do not give the time zone when defaulting to the current time and the time zone for all of ilib was not set with ilib.setTimeZone(), then the time zone will default to UTC (\"Universal Time, Coordinated\" or \"Greenwich Mean Time\"). If any of the properties from year through millisecond are not specified in the params, it is assumed that they have the smallest possible value in the range for the property (zero or one). new ThaiSolarDate( [params]) Parameters: Name Type Argument Description params Object &lt;optional&gt; parameters that govern the settings and behaviour of this Thai solar date Extends GregorianDate Members day :number The day of the month. This ranges from 1 to 31. Type: number Inherited From: GregorianDate#day hour :number The hour of the day. This can be a number from 0 to 23, as times are stored unambiguously in the 24-hour clock. Type: number Inherited From: GregorianDate#hour millisecond :number The millisecond of the second. Ranges from 0 to 999.

Type: number Inherited From: GregorianDate#year Overrides: GregorianDate#year Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcDateComponents() Calculate the date components for the current time zone Overrides: GregorianDate#_calcDateComponents after(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week after the current date that is being sought Overrides: GregorianDate#after Returns: the date being sought Type IDate before(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week before the current date that is being sought Overrides: GregorianDate#before Returns: the date being sought Type IDate &lt;protected&gt; firstSunday(year) Return the rd number of the first Sunday of the given ISO year. Parameters: Name Type Description year number the year for which the first Sunday is being sought Inherited From: IDate#firstSunday Returns: the rd of the first Sunday of the ISO year Type number getCalendar() Return the name of the calendar that governs this date. Overrides: GregorianDate#getCalendar Returns: a string giving the name of the calendar Type string getDayOfWeek() Return the day of the week of this date. The day of the week is encoded as number from 0 to 6, with 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc., until 6=Saturday. Inherited From: GregorianDate#getDayOfWeek Returns: the day of the week Type number getDayOfYear() Return the ordinal day of the year. Days are counted from 1 and proceed linearly up to 365, regardless of months or weeks, etc. That is, January 1st is day 1, and December 31st is 365 in regular years, or 366 in leap years. Inherited From: GregorianDate#getDayOfYear Returns: the ordinal day of the year Type number getEra() Return the era for this date as a number. The value for the era for Gregorian calendars is -1 for \"before the common era\" (BCE) and 1 for \"the common era\" (CE). BCE dates are any date before Jan 1, 1 CE. In the proleptic Gregorian calendar, there is a year 0, so any years that are negative or zero are BCE. In the Julian calendar, there is no year 0. Instead, the calendar goes straight from year -1 to 1. Inherited From: GregorianDate#getEra Returns: 1 if this date is in the common era, -1 if it is before the common era Type number getJSDate() Return a Javascript Date object that is equivalent to this date object. Inherited From: IDate#getJSDate Returns: a javascript Date object Type Date | undefined getJulianDay() Return the Julian Day equivalent to this calendar date as a number. Inherited From: IDate#getJulianDay Returns: the julian date equivalent of this date Type number &lt;protected&gt; getRataDie() Return the Rata Die (fixed day) number of this date. Overrides: GregorianDate#getRataDie Returns: the rd date as a number Type number getTime() Return the unix time equivalent to this date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian). This method only returns a valid number for dates between midnight, Jan 1, 1970 UTC (Gregorian) and Jan 19, 2038 at 3:14:07am UTC (Gregorian) when the unix time runs out. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return -1. For date types that are not Gregorian, the point in time represented by this date object will only give a return value if it is in the correct range in the Gregorian calendar as given previously. Inherited From: IDate#getTime Returns: a number giving the unix time, or -1 if the date is outside the valid unix time range Type number getTimeExtended() Return the extended unix time equivalent to this Gregorian date instance. Unix time is the number of milliseconds since midnight on Jan 1, 1970 UTC. Traditionally unix time (or the type \"time_t\" in C/C++) is only encoded with an unsigned 32 bit integer, and thus runs out on Jan 19, 2038. However, most Javascript engines encode numbers well above 32 bits and the Date object allows you to encode up to 100 million days worth of time after Jan 1, 1970, and even more interestingly, 100 million days worth of time before Jan 1, 1970 as well. This method returns the number of milliseconds in that extended range. If this instance encodes a date outside of that range, this method will return NaN. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeExtended Returns: a number giving the extended unix time, or Nan if the date is outside the valid extended unix time range Type number getTimeZone() Return the time zone associated with this date, or undefined if none was specified in the constructor. Inherited From: IDate#getTimeZone Returns: the name of the time zone for this date instance Type string | undefined getWeekOfMonth(locale) Return the ordinal number of the week within the month. The first week of a month is the first one that contains 4 or more days in that month. If any days precede this first week, they are marked as being in week 0. This function returns values from 0 through 6. The locale is a required parameter because different locales that use the same Gregorian calendar consider different days of the week to be the beginning of the week. This can affect the week of the month in which some days are located. Parameters: Name Type Description locale Locale | string the locale or locale spec to use when figuring out the first day of the week Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfMonth Returns: the ordinal number of the week within the current month Type number getWeekOfYear() Return the ISO 8601 week number in the current year for the current date. The week number ranges from 0 to 55, as some years have 55 weeks assigned to them in some calendars. Inherited From: IDate#getWeekOfYear Returns: the week number for the current date Type number onOrAfter(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or after the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or after the current date that is being sought Overrides: GregorianDate#onOrAfter Returns: the date being sought Type IDate onOrBefore(dow) Return a new Gregorian date instance that represents the first instance of the given day of the week on or before the current date. The day of the week is encoded as a number where 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc. Parameters: Name Type Description dow number the day of the week on or before the current date that is being sought Overrides: GregorianDate#onOrBefore Returns: the date being sought Type IDate setJulianDay(date) Set the date of this instance using a Julian Day. Parameters: Name Type Description date number | JulianDay the Julian Day to use to set this date Inherited From: IDate#setJulianDay &lt;protected&gt; setRd(rd) Set the date components of this instance based on the given rd.

This class reports and transforms information about particular time zones. The options parameter may contain any of the following properties: id - The id of the requested time zone such as \"Europe/London\" or \"America/Los_Angeles\". These are taken from the IANA time zone database. (See http://www.iana.org/time-zones for more information.) There is one special time zone that is not taken from the IANA database called simply \"local\". In this case, this class will attempt to discover the current time zone and daylight savings time settings by calling standard Javascript classes to determine the offsets from UTC. locale - The locale for this time zone. offset - Choose the time zone based on the offset from UTC given in number of minutes (negative is west, positive is east). onLoad - a callback function to call when the data is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, this class will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the data is loaded, the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. There is currently no way in the ECMAscript standard to tell which exact time zone is currently in use. Choosing the id \"locale\" or specifying an explicit offset will not give a specific time zone, as it is impossible to tell with certainty which zone the offsets match. When the id \"local\" is given or the offset option is specified, this class will have the following behaviours: The display name will always be given as the RFC822 style, no matter what style is requested The id will also be returned as the RFC822 style display name When the offset is explicitly given, this class will assume the time zone does not support daylight savings time, and the offsets will be calculated the same way year round. When the offset is explicitly given, the inDaylightSavings() method will always return false. When the id \"local\" is given, this class will attempt to determine the daylight savings time settings by examining the offset from UTC on Jan 1 and June 1 of the current year. If they are different, this class assumes that the local time zone uses DST. When the offset for a particular date is requested, it will use the built-in Javascript support to determine the offset for that date. If a more specific time zone is needed with display names and known start/stop times for DST, use the \"id\" property instead to specify the time zone exactly. You can perhaps ask the user which time zone they prefer so that your app does not need to guess. If the id and the offset are both not given, the default time zone for the locale is retrieved from the locale info. If the locale is not specified, the default locale for the library is used. Because this class was designed for use in web sites, and the vast majority of dates and times being formatted are recent date/times, this class is simplified by not implementing historical time zones. That is, when governments change the time zone rules for a particular zone, only the latest such rule is implemented in this class. That means that determining the offset for a date that is prior to the last change may give the wrong result. Historical time zone calculations may be implemented in a later version of iLib if there is enough demand for it, but it would entail a much larger set of time zone data that would have to be loaded. new TimeZone(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object Options guiding the construction of this time zone instance Methods &lt;protected&gt; _calcRuleStart(rule, year) return the rd of the start of DST transition for the given year Parameters: Name Type Description rule Object set of rules year number year to check Returns: the rd of the start of DST for the year Type number &lt;protected&gt; _getOffsetMillisWallTime(date) Return the offset in milliseconds when the date has an RD number in wall time rather than in UTC time. Parameters: Name Type Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number the date to check in wall time Returns: the number of milliseconds of offset from UTC that the given date is Type number getCountry() Returns the ISO 3166 code of the country for which this time zone is defined. Returns: the ISO 3166 code of the country for this zone Type string getDSTSavings() Return the amount of time in hours:minutes that the clock is advanced during daylight savings time. Returns: the amount of time that the clock advances for DST in hours, minutes, and seconds Type Object.&lt;{h:number, m:number, s:number}&gt; getDSTSavingsStr() Return the amount of time in hours:minutes that the clock is advanced during daylight savings time. Returns: the amount of time that the clock advances for DST in the format \"h:m:s\" Type string getDisplayName(date [, style]) Return the abbreviation that is used for the current time zone on the given date. The date may be in DST or during standard time, and many zone names have different abbreviations depending on whether or not the date is falls within DST. There are two styles that are supported: standard - returns the 3 to 5 letter abbreviation of the time zone name such as \"CET\" for \"Central European Time\" or \"PDT\" for \"Pacific Daylight Time\" rfc822 - returns an RFC 822 style time zone specifier, which specifies more explicitly what the offset is from UTC long - returns the long name of the zone in English Parameters: Name Type Argument Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number a date to determine if it is in daylight time or standard time style string &lt;optional&gt; one of \"standard\" or \"rfc822\". Default if not specified is \"standard\" Returns: the name of the time zone, abbreviated according to the style Type string getId() Return the id used to uniquely identify this time zone. Returns: a unique id for this time zone Type string getOffset(date) Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the given date/time. If daylight saving time is in effect at the given date/time, this method will return the offset value adjusted by the amount of daylight saving. Parameters: Name Type Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number the date for which the offset is needed Returns: an object giving the offset for the zone at the given date/time, in hours, minutes, and seconds Type Object.&lt;{h:number, m:number}&gt; getOffsetMillis(date) Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the given date/time expressed in milliseconds. If daylight saving time is in effect at the given date/time, this method will return the offset value adjusted by the amount of daylight saving. Negative numbers indicate offsets west of UTC and conversely, positive numbers indicate offset east of UTC. Parameters: Name Type Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number the date for which the offset is needed, or null for the present date Returns: the number of milliseconds of offset from UTC that the given date is Type number getOffsetStr(date) Returns the offset of this time zone from UTC at the given date/time. If daylight saving time is in effect at the given date/time, this method will return the offset value adjusted by the amount of daylight saving. Parameters: Name Type Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number the date for which the offset is needed Returns: the offset for the zone at the given date/time as a string in the format \"h:m:s\" Type string getRawOffset() Gets the offset from UTC for this time zone. Returns: an object giving the offset from UTC for this time zone, in hours, minutes, and seconds Type Object.&lt;{h:number, m:number, s:number}&gt; getRawOffsetMillis() Gets the offset from UTC for this time zone expressed in milliseconds. Negative numbers indicate zones west of UTC, and positive numbers indicate zones east of UTC. Returns: an number giving the offset from UTC for this time zone in milliseconds Type number getRawOffsetStr() Gets the offset from UTC for this time zone without DST savings. Returns: the offset from UTC for this time zone, in the format \"h:m:s\" Type string inDaylightTime(date [, wallTime]) Returns whether or not the given date is in daylight saving time for the current zone. Note that daylight savings time is observed for the summer. Because the seasons are reversed, daylight savings time in the southern hemisphere usually runs from the end of the year through New Years into the first few months of the next year. This method will correctly calculate the start and end of DST for any location. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description date IDate | Object | JulianDay | Date | string | number a date for which the info about daylight time is being sought, or undefined to tell whether we are currently in daylight savings time wallTime boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, then the given date is in wall time. If false or undefined, it is in the usual UTC time. Returns: true if the given date is in DST for the current zone, and false otherwise. Type boolean useDaylightTime(year) Returns true if this time zone switches to daylight savings time at some point in the year, and false otherwise. Parameters: Name Type Description year number Whether or not the time zone uses daylight time in the given year. If this parameter is not given, the current year is assumed. Returns: true if the time zone uses daylight savings time Type boolean &lt;static&gt; getAvailableIds(country, sync, onLoad) Return an array of available zone ids that the constructor knows about. The country parameter is optional. If it is not given, all time zones will be returned. If it specifies a country code, then only time zones for that country will be returned.

The unit formatter is immutable once it is created, but can format as many different strings with different values as needed with the same options. Create different unit formatter instances for different purposes and then keep them cached for use later if you have more than one unit string to format. The options may contain any of the following properties: locale - locale to use when formatting the units. The locale also controls the translation of the names of the units. If the locale is not specified, then the default locale of the app or web page will be used. autoScale - when true, automatically scale the amount to get the smallest number greater than 1, where possible, possibly by converting units within the locale's measurement system. For example, if the current locale is \"en-US\", and we have a measurement containing 278 fluid ounces, then the number \"278\" can be scaled down by converting the units to a larger one such as gallons. The scaled size would be 2.17188 gallons. Since iLib does not have a US customary measure larger than gallons, it cannot scale it down any further. If the amount is less than the smallest measure already, it cannot be scaled down any further and no autoscaling will be applied. Default for the autoScale property is \"true\", so it only needs to be specified when you want to turn off autoscaling. autoConvert - automatically convert the units to the nearest appropriate measure of the same type in the measurement system used by the locale. For example, if a measurement of length is given in meters, but the current locale is \"en-US\" which uses the US Customary system, then the nearest appropriate measure would be \"yards\", and the amount would be converted from meters to yards automatically before being formatted. Default for the autoConvert property is \"true\", so it only needs to be specified when you want to turn off autoconversion. usage - describe the reason for the measure. For example, the usage of a formatter may be for a \"person height\", which implies that certain customary units should be used, even though other measures in the same system may be more efficient. In US Customary measures, a person's height is traditionally given in feet and inches, even though yards, feet and inches would be more efficient and logical. Specifying a usage implies that the autoScale is turned on so that the measure can be scaled to the level required for the customary measures for the usage. Setting the usage can also implicitly set the style, the max- and minFractionDigits, roundingMode, length, etc. if those options are not explicitly given in this options object. If they are given, the explicit settings override the defaults of the usage. Usages imply that the formatter should be used with a specific type of measurement. If the format method is called on a measurement that is of the wrong type for the usage, it will be formatted as a regular measurement with default options. List of usages currently supported: general no specific usage with no preselected measures. (Default which does not restrict the units used for any type of measurement.) floorSpace area of the floor of a house or building landArea area of a piece of plot of land networkingSpeed speed of transfer of data over a network audioSpeed speed of transfer of audio data interfaceSpeed speed of transfer of data over a computer interface such as a USB or SATA bus foodEnergy amount of energy contains in food electricalEnergy amount of energy in electricity heatingEnergy amount of energy required to heat things such as water or home interiors babyHeight length of a baby personHeight height of an adult or child (not a baby) vehicleDistance distance traveled by a vehicle or aircraft (except a boat) nauticalDistance distance traveled by a boat personWeight weight/mass of an adult human or larger child babyWeight weight/mass of a baby or of small animals such as cats and dogs vehicleWeight weight/mass of a vehicle (including a boat) drugWeight weight/mass of a medicinal drug vehicleSpeed speed of travel of a vehicle or aircraft (except a boat) nauticalSpeed speed of travel of a boat dryFoodVolume volume of a dry food substance in a recipe such as flour liquidFoodVolume volume of a liquid food substance in a recipe such as milk drinkVolume volume of a drink fuelVolume volume of a vehicular fuel engineVolume volume of an engine's combustion space storageVolume volume of a mass storage tank gasVolume volume of a gas such as natural gas used in a home style - give the style of this formatter. This is used to decide how to format the number and units when the number is not whole, or becomes not whole after auto conversion and scaling. There are two basic styles supported so far: numeric - only the largest unit is used and the number is given as decimals. Example: \"5.25 lbs\" list - display the measure with a list of successively smaller-sized units. Example: \"5 lbs 4 oz\" The style is most useful for units which are not powers of 10 greater than the smaller units as in the metric system, though it can be useful for metric measures as well. Example: \"2kg 381g\". The style may be set implicitly when you set the usage. For example, if the usage is \"personWeight\", the style will be \"numeric\" and the maxFractionDigits will be 0. That is, weight of adults and children are most often given in whole pounds. (eg. \"172 lbs\"). If the usage is \"babyWeight\", the style will be \"list\", and the measures will be pounds and ounces. (eg. \"7 lbs 2 oz\"). length - the length of the units text. This can be either \"short\" or \"long\" with the default being \"long\". Example: a short units text might be \"kph\" and the corresponding long units text would be \"kilometers per hour\". Typically, it is the long units text that is translated per locale, though the short one may be as well. Plurals are taken care of properly per locale as well. maxFractionDigits - the maximum number of digits that should appear in the formatted output after the decimal. A value of -1 means unlimited, and 0 means only print the integral part of the number. minFractionDigits - the minimum number of fractional digits that should appear in the formatted output. If the number does not have enough fractional digits to reach this minimum, the number will be zero-padded at the end to get to the limit. significantDigits - the number of significant digits that should appear in the formatted output. If the given number is less than 1, this option will be ignored. roundingMode - When the maxFractionDigits or maxIntegerDigits is specified, this property governs how the least significant digits are rounded to conform to that maximum. The value of this property is a string with one of the following values: up - round away from zero down - round towards zero. This has the effect of truncating the number ceiling - round towards positive infinity floor - round towards negative infinity halfup - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round up. halfdown - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round down. halfeven - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round towards the even neighbour halfodd - round towards nearest neighbour. If equidistant, round towards the odd neighbour Default if this is not specified is \"halfup\". onLoad - a callback function to call when the date format object is fully loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the UnitFmt object will attempt to load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback. When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two. sync - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or asynchronously. If this option is given as \"false\", then the \"onLoad\" callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will not be usable for a while. loadParams - an object containing parameters to pass to the loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean. Here is an example of how you might use the unit formatter to format a string with the correct units. new UnitFmt(options) Parameters: Name Type Description options Object options governing the way this date formatter instance works Methods format(measurement) Format a particular unit instance according to the settings of this formatter object.

Returns: the measurement system used in this formatter Type string getScale() Return whether or not this formatter will auto-scale the units while formatting. Returns: true if auto-scaling is turned on Type boolean getTemplate() Return the template string that is used to format date/times for this formatter instance. This will work, even when the template property is not explicitly given in the options to the constructor. Without the template option, the constructor will build the appropriate template according to the options and use that template in the format method. Returns: the format template for this formatter Type string toString() Convert this formatter to a string representation by returning the format template. This method delegates to getTemplate.

This should method be used as a last resort if no case-sensitive match is found amongst all the different types of measurements. Parameters: Name Type Description unit string the unit to find Inherited From: Measurement#getUnitIdCaseInsensitive Returns: the normalized identifier for the given unit, or undefined if there is no such unit in this type of measurement Type string | undefined list(measures, ratios, constrain [, scale]) Convert the current measurement to a list of measures and amounts. This method will autoScale the current measurement to the largest measure in the given measures list such that the amount of that measure is still greater than or equal to 1. From there, it will truncate that measure to a whole number and then it will calculate the remainder in terms of each of the smaller measures in the given list. For example, if a person's height is given as 70.5 inches, and the list of measures is [\"mile\", \"foot\", \"inch\"], then it will scale the amount to 5 feet, 10.5 inches. The amount is not big enough to have any whole miles, so that measure is not used. The first measure will be \"foot\" because it is the first one in the measure list where the there is an amount of them that is greater than or equal to 1. The return value in this example would be: [ { \"unit\": \"foot\", \"amount\": 5 }, { \"unit\": \"inch\", \"amount\": 10.5 } ] Note that all measures except the smallest will be returned as whole numbers. The smallest measure will contain any possible fractional remainder. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measures Array.&lt;string&gt; | undefined array of measure names to convert this measure to ratios Object the conversion ratios table for the measurement type constrain function a function that constrains a number according to the display options scale boolean &lt;optional&gt; if true, rescale all of the units so that the largest unit is the largest one with a non-fractional number. If false, then the current unit stays the largest unit. Inherited From: Measurement#list Returns: the conversion of the current measurement into an array of unit names and their amounts Type Array.&lt;{unit: String, amount: Number}&gt; localize(locale) Localize the measurement to the commonly used measurement in that locale. For example If a user's locale is \"en-US\" and the measurement is given as \"60 kmh\", the formatted number should be automatically converted to the most appropriate measure in the other system, in this case, mph. The formatted result should appear as \"37.3 mph\". Parameters: Name Type Description locale string current locale string Overrides: Measurement#localize Returns: a new instance that is converted to locale Type Measurement normalizeUnits(name) Return the normalized name of the given units. If the units are not recognized, this method returns its parameter unmodified.

Inherited From: Measurement#normalizeUnits Returns: normalized name of the units Type string scale( [measurementsystem]) Scale the measurement unit to an acceptable level. The scaling happens so that the integer part of the amount is as small as possible without being below zero. This will result in the largest units that can represent this measurement without fractions. Measurements can only be scaled to other measurements of the same type. Parameters: Name Type Argument Description measurementsystem string &lt;optional&gt; system to use (uscustomary|imperial|metric), or undefined if the system can be inferred from the current measure Overrides: Measurement#scale Returns: a new instance that is scaled to the right level Type Measurement &lt;static&gt; convert(to, from, unknown) Convert a unknown to another measure.

Merged data is created whenever a locale is specified where the data for a locale data resides in various files, and these need to be merged together to create the overall data for that locale. For example, if the ilib locale is \"fr-CA\", the final locale data is assembled from the following locale parts: root - the root/default locale data shared by every locale fr - the locale data shared by every flavour of French (eg. translations or date formats) und/CA - the language-independent locale data for Canada (eg. time zone or official currency) fr/CA - the locale data that is unique to French for Canada (eg. date or currency formats) On some platforms, the data loaded from disk is cached and then merged each time it is needed to create the whole locale data for the current locale. In other platforms, the merging is too slow, so the already-merged data is cached as well after the first time it is requested. In this way, we sacrifice the memory footprint for the sake of speed. &lt;static&gt; data Place where resources and such are eventually assigned. Methods &lt;static&gt; bind(scope, method) If Function.prototype.bind does not exist in this JS engine, this function reimplements it in terms of older JS functions. bind() doesn't exist in many older browsers.

It returns false for pre-assembled data. Returns: true if this ilib uses dynamically loaded locale data, and false otherwise Type boolean &lt;static&gt; setAsPseudoLocale(localename) Sets the pseudo locale. Pseudolocalization (or pseudo-localization) is used for testing internationalization aspects of software. Instead of translating the text of the software into a foreign language, as in the process of localization, the textual elements of an application are replaced with an altered version of the original language.These specific alterations make the original words appear readable, but include the most problematic characteristics of the world's languages: varying length of text or characters, language direction, and so on.

Loader Defines the interface for the loader class for ilib. The main method of the loader object is loadFiles(), which loads a set of requested locale data files from where-ever it is stored. Methods isAvailable() Return true if the file in the named path is available for loading using this loader. The path may be given as an absolute path, in which case only that file is checked, or as a relative path, in which case, the relative path may appear underneath any of the directories that the loader knows about. Returns: true if the file in the named path is available for loading, and false otherwise Type boolean listAvailableFiles() Return all files available for loading using this loader instance. This method returns an object where the properties are the paths to directories where files are loaded from and the values are an array of strings containing the relative paths under the directory of each file that can be loaded. Example: { \"/usr/share/javascript/ilib/locale\": [ \"dateformats.json\", \"aa/dateformats.json\", \"af/dateformats.json\", \"agq/dateformats.json\", \"ak/dateformats.json\", ... \"zxx/dateformats.json\" ] } Returns: a hash containing directory names and paths to file that can be loaded by this loader Type Object loadFiles(paths, sync, params, callback) Load a set of files from where-ever it is stored. This is the main function define a callback function for loading missing locale data or resources. If this copy of ilib is assembled without including the required locale data or resources, then that data can be lazy loaded dynamically when it is needed by calling this method. Each ilib class will first check for the existence of data under ilib.data, and if it is not there, it will attempt to load it by calling this method of the loader, and then place it there. Suggested implementations of this method might load files directly from disk under nodejs or rhino, or within web pages, to load files from the server with XHR calls. The first parameter to this method, paths, is an array of relative paths within the ilib dir structure for the requested data. These paths will already have the locale spec integrated into them, so no further tweaking needs to happen to load the data. Simply load the named files. The second parameter tells the loader whether to load the files synchronously or asynchronously. If the sync parameters is false, then the onLoad function must also be specified. The third parameter gives extra parameters to the loader passed from the calling code. This may contain any property/value pairs. The last parameter, callback, is a callback function to call when all of the data is finishing loading. Make sure to call the callback with the context of \"this\" so that the caller has their context back again. The loader function must be able to operate either synchronously or asychronously. If the loader function is called with an undefined callback function, it is expected to load the data synchronously, convert it to javascript objects, and return the array of json objects as the return value of the function. If the loader function is called with a callback function, it may load the data synchronously or asynchronously (doesn't matter which) as long as it calls the callback function with the data converted to a javascript objects when it becomes available. If a particular file could not be loaded, the loader function should put undefined into the corresponding entry in the results array. Note that it is important that all the data is loaded before the callback is called. An example implementation for nodejs might be: var fs = require(\"fs\"); var myLoader = function() {}; myLoader.prototype = new Loader(); myLoader.prototype.constructor = myLoader; myLoader.prototype.loadFiles = function(paths, sync, params, callback) { if (sync) { var ret = []; // synchronous load -- just return the result paths.forEach(function (path) { var json = fs.readFileSync(path, \"utf-8\"); ret.push(json ? JSON.parse(json) : undefined); }); return ret; } this.callback = callback; // asynchronous this.results = []; this._loadFilesAsync(paths); } myLoader.prototype._loadFilesAsync = function (paths) { if (paths.length &gt; 0) { var file = paths.shift(); fs.readFile(file, \"utf-8\", function(err, json) { this.results.push(err ? undefined : JSON.parse(json)); // call self recursively so that the callback is only called at the end // when all the files are loaded sequentially if (paths.length &gt; 0) { this._loadFilesAsync(paths); } else { this.callback(this.results); } }); } } // bind to \"this\" so that \"this\" is relative to your own instance ilib.setLoaderCallback(new myLoader()); Parameters: Name Type Description paths Array.&lt;string&gt; An array of paths to load from wherever the files are stored sync Boolean if true, load the files synchronously, and false means asynchronously params Object an object with any extra parameters for the loader. These can be anything. The caller of the ilib class passes these parameters in. Presumably, the code that calls ilib and the code that provides the loader are together and can have a private agreement between them about what the parameters should contain. callback function function to call when the files are all loaded. The parameter of the callback function is the contents of the files. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 4.0.0 on 2023-01-10T15:16:56+09:00 using the DocStrap template. "}}
