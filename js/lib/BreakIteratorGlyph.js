/**
 * @class A class that locates character boundaries in text, and acts as an iterator
 * over chunks of text between those boundaries.
 *
 * The options parameter can be an object that contains the following
 * properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the iterator is fully
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the break iterator will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 *
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The way this break iterator works can be summarized as follows:<p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Once the iterator is created, it is immutable after that. If the code
 * would like to iterate over a different string, a new iterator must be created.
 * <li>The beginning and the end of the text count as boundaries.
 * <li>The iterator can move forwards or backwards to boundaries
 * <li>The iterator has a position on one of the boundaries in the text, and
 * returns the text of the chunk between the current boundary and the next
 * or previous boundary.
 * <li>Chunks are always at least one character in length.
 * <li>When the iterator reaches the end of the text, the next method returns
 * undefined as the chunk. Similarly, when the iterator is at the beginning
 * of the text, the previous method returns undefined.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {String} string the string to iterate over
 * @param {Object=} options options controlling the construction of this instance, or
 * undefined to use the default options
