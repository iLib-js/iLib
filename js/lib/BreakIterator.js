/**
 * @class A class that locates boundaries in text, and acts as an iterator
 * over chunks of text between those boundaries.
 *
 * The options parameter can be an object that contains the following
 * properties:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>type</i> - specify the type of the iterator desired. The
 * list of valid values is "character", "glyph", "word", "sentence", and
 * "line". Default is "character".
 *
 * <li><i>locale</i> - the locale of this iterator, which controls the
 * grammatical rules behind things like what is a word and what is
 * not, and which punctuation ends a sentence and what are the exceptions
 * to those rules. Default is the current locale.
 * 
 * <li><i>maxLength</i> - set the maximum number of characters in a line.
 * This parameter is ignored if the type is not given as "line". Default is 80.
 *
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the iterator is fully
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the break iterator will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 *
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The locale controls the grammatical rules behind things like what parts of
 * a string form a word and which do not, and which punctuation characters
 * end a sentence and what are the exceptions to those. The actual text boundaries
 * are calculated using the rules from the Unicode Standard Annex #29, Text
 * Boundaries, and from the Unicode Standard Annex #14, Line Breaking Properties.
 * These documents can be found at http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/ and
 * http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/ <p>
 *
 * The way this break iterator works can be summarized as follows:<p>
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Once the iterator is created, it is immutable after that. If the code
 * would like to iterate over a different string, a new iterator must be created.
 * <li>The beginning and the end of the text count as boundaries.
 * <li>The iterator can move forwards or backwards to boundaries
 * <li>The iterator has a position on one of the boundaries in the text, and
 * returns the text of the chunk between the current boundary and the next
 * or previous boundary.
 * <li>Chunks are always at least one character in length.
 * <li>When the iterator reaches the end of the text, the next method returns
 * undefined as the chunk. Similarly, when the iterator is at the beginning
 * of the text, the previous method returns undefined.
 * </ol>
 *
 * When the type is given as "line", the text boundaries correspond to the
 * position in the text where a line break should be inserted such that the
 * resulting lines would be less than the max number of characters per line.
 * If a word occurs which is longer than the max length, it will be put on a
 * line of its own with the length of the line exceeding the max length.
 *
 * @constructor
 * @param {String} string the string to iterate over
 * @param {Object=} options options controlling the construction of this instance, or
 * undefined to use the default options
