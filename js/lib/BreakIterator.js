/**
 * @class A class that locates boundaries in text, and acts as an iterator 
 * over those boundaries.
 * 
 * The options parameter can be an object that contains the following
 * properties:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li><i>type</i> - specify the type of the iterator desired. The
 * list of valid values is "character", "glyph", "word", and 
 * "sentence". Default is "character".
 * 
 * <li><i>locale</i> - the locale of this iterator, which controls the
 * grammatical rules behind things like what is a word and what is
 * not, and which punctuation ends a sentence and what are the exceptions
 * to those rules. Default is the current locale.
 *  
 * <li><i>onLoad</i> - a callback function to call when the iterator is fully 
 * loaded. When the onLoad option is given, the break iterator will attempt to
 * load any missing locale data using the ilib loader callback.
 * When the constructor is done (even if the data is already preassembled), the 
 * onLoad function is called with the current instance as a parameter, so this
 * callback can be used with preassembled or dynamic loading or a mix of the two.
 * 
 * <li><i>sync</i> - tell whether to load any missing locale data synchronously or 
 * asynchronously. If this option is given as "false", then the "onLoad"
 * callback must be given, as the instance returned from this constructor will
 * not be usable for a while.
 *  
 * <li><i>loadParams</i> - an object containing parameters to pass to the 
 * loader callback function when locale data is missing. The parameters are not
 * interpretted or modified in any way. They are simply passed along. The object 
 * may contain any property/value pairs as long as the calling code is in
 * agreement with the loader callback function as to what those parameters mean.
 * </ul>    

 * 
 * The locale controls the grammatical rules behind things like what parts of 
 * a string form a word and which do not, and which punctuation characters 
 * end a sentence and what are the exceptions to those.
 * 
 * @static
 * @param {String} string the string to iterate over
 * @param {Object=} options options controlling the construction of this instance, or
 * undefined to use the default options
 * @return {Calendar} an instance of a calendar object of the appropriate type
